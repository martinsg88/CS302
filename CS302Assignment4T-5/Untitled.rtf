\{// 1.00 - September 24, 2009\
  - Gin's route is up, along with info on the optional Lucifer boss battle.\
    And whoops, while I was editing I didn't fully correct the stuff on the\
    Mari/Kudlak battles, so that should be fixed now. Also finished writing\
    up all the Day 5 possible battles. Corrected other things.\
  - Added a few more mini-sections under Nos. 6 and 7. Changed 28.\
  - For now, this is the 'finished' version of the guide. When I have time,\
    I'll probably add a few things like specific fusion lists, demons in the\
    auction and their skills/etc, blah blah. There's also a few things I want\
    to fix up. But this covers most of it.\
\
\{// 0.83 - September 1, 2009\
  - Naoya's/Kaido's route is up. Finished the fusion stuff and database, and\
    the skill lists. Fixed some typos and errors.\
  - I tried putting in more notes to make some things a little more obvious,\
    like "even if you follow the route outline, if you -don't answer dialogue\
    questions and emails well, you won't unlock it-," and "if your demons\
    aren't up to date you'll definitely be struggling," etc etc.\
\
\{// 0.70 - August 10, 2009\
  - Slowly, unsteadily, but surely hacking this out. (I started a month ago,\
    yeeeeah. Not that I, er, worked on it that long.)\
  - First version up on GameFAQs. Info for Days 1-6 is up, along with Yuzu's,\
    Atsuro's, and Amane's routes.\
  - Next priority: Complete Skill List information, auction/demon things, \
    alternate Day 7 routes, advised fusions. ...When I get to formatting it \
    all, yeah I'm lazy. And If there's something I haven't included that you\
    think would help the guide, please suggest it.\

\
Hello, and thanks for reading this guide. I'm DS, or DarkenedSakura, and\
basically a huge lurker at GameFAQs whom most of you probably haven't seen\
before. (Not too keen on posting, what can I say...) I usually don't write\
guides, but I figured that Devil Survivor would be the only game I'd ever get\
soon enough where writing a nonredundant guide would be possible, so.\
\
This is essentially my first gameplay guide, so this isn't going to be anywhere\
near perfect. I will get to all the routes eventually, please be patient.\
Otherwise, feel free to tell me anything I'm missing. The events system in\
particular I have fairly messy notes on, so yes.\
\
Oh, also. This guide's fairly spoiler-free...but there will obviously be\
spoilery things in the battle sections and the "Route Spoilers" sections.\
Fair warning.\

email again, and please be understanding. :);;;\
\
Uhmmmm and. Please don't complain to me about the pace at which I'm updating\
this - I don't want to sound all "grr argh," but I've got a load of other\
projects and various real life committments. It'll get done, I promise.\

   \{ As He proclaimed...this world, created in seven days, shall be destroyed\
     with the sounding of seven trumpets. You who have a will, fear the\
     numbers your eyes shall see. Fear the time left... \}\
\
It's an ordinary day. You're supposed to be spending time with your friends,\
Atsuro and Yuzu, and your cousin, Naoya. Instead, he gives you three modified\
COMPs, or Communication Players, that suddenly summon demons and make the\
three of you demon tamers. You also receive emails predicting the future, and\
you can see "death clocks" above people's heads, a countdown to their deaths.\
\
Soon after, Tokyo is put under lockdown, and you see that most people's clocks\
are set to seven days - at the most. What's going to happen? Can you survive?\
\
\
Devil Survivor is part of the Japanese Shin Megami Tensei franchise, by Atlus.\
This particular SRPG sports a turn-based battle system, an events system where\
you interact with various characters, and six alternate endings depending on\
what events you've caused - or not.\
\
Strategic maneuvering, against-the-clock event-pursuing, and what might be a\
hellish Last Day - yeah, it can get addicting.\

\
Names are listed in order of given name, family name (not the Japanese order).\
\
\
(A) Main\
    Age: 17\
    Playable routes: all\
\
The protagonist of the story. His name and dialogue are completely up to you - \
at least, given the options you get in the game. A bit of the silent type, and\
good friends with Atsuro and Yuzu. His cousin, Naoya, lived with him for a \
while, and they're like brothers.\
\
The MC is the only character whose stats you can completely customize.\
\
\
(B) Atsuro Kihara\
    Age: 17\
    Email Handle: AT-LOW\
    Playable routes: all\
\
He's the main's best friend and high school classmate. Atsuro met Naoya online\
through a forum, and is now his apprentice of sorts in learning about computer\
programming. It's up to him throughout the game to figure out more about the\
COMPs and handle the technological aspect of things. He puts up a strong front\
especially when Yuzu freaks out, and he secretly confides to the MC that he\
believes keeping demons around in the world wouldn't be so bad.\
\
Atsuro's growths focus heavily on str/vit, and he'll be your strongest physical\
attacker for most of the game. His magic's a bit lacking, however, but high\
enough to give him some skill capacity variability. He has a movement range of\
4. He's the only character besides the MC who'll stick around for every route.\
\
\
(C) Yuzu Tanikawa\
    Age: 17\
    Email Handle: YUZ\
    Playable routes: all except Naoya's\
\
She's a childhood friend and high school classmate of the MC's, and spends a\
lot of time yelling at Atsuro over her unwanted nickname of "Yoo-hoo." She's a\
normal girl who just wants to get out of the lockdown and go home, go\
shopping, have a boyfriend, have a life. Out of everyone, she voices the most\
doubt and uncertainty, but holds herself together for the sake of the group.\
\
To me, Yuzu gets a weird rap on the boards. She's not that bad, you know?\
She's pretty normal, reacting to the lockdown the way she does, and reacts\
better than a lot of people would. In our humble opinions, haha.\
\
Yuzu has some of the best magic growths in the game, and a high starting speed\
of 53. Her weak point, however, is a meager movement range of 3. Nothing you\
can't fix with certain demons, however.\
\
\
(D) Naoya\
    Age: 24\
    Email handle: NAOYA\
    Playable routes: Naoya's, Kaido's\
\
He lost his parents at an early age and lived with the MC's family, until he\
moved out and got his own apartment in Aoyama a few years ago. He's like a\
brother to the MC.\
\
Naoya's a genius programmer, as Atsuro constantly reminds the group. He sends\
the three of them COMPs at the beginning of the game, but what are his real\
reasons for doing so...?\
\
Naoya has very strong magic like Yuzu. His agility's slightly lower, but his\
vitality's higher. He has a movement range of 4. On his and Kaido's routes,\
he'll be a great replacement for Yuzu.\
\
\
(E) Keisuke Takagi\
    Age: 17\
    Email handle: K-T\
    Playable routes: all except Naoya's\
\
Atsuro was good friends with him in middle school, though they lost touch\
afterwards. According to Atsuro, he always "looked out for the little guy."\
Quiet and reserved, Keisuke's thoughtful and observant, and along with Atsuro\
furthers many of the group's theories about their situation. Still, everyone\
has a snapping point, and after certain lines are crossed, Keisuke is no\
exception...\
\
Keisuke has high agility and a speed of 55. His magic's favored over his\
strength and his defense/vitality is somewhat low. He has a movement range of\
4.\
\
\
(F) Midori Komaki\
    Age: 15\
    Email handle: DOLLY\
    Playable routes: all except Naoya's\
\
A famous camgirl on the internet who goes by the name of Dolly, she's liked by\
guys and girls alike for her easygoing and nice attitude. She's easily\
recognizable due to her anime cosplay outfit. When she gets her hands on a\
COMP, she's excited to play the hero and save people...but her refusal to see\
certain truths causes more problems than she realizes. Being a hero in the\
lockdown isn't so straightforward...\
\
Midori's magic is a little bit lower than Yuzu's and her strength's about the\
same, but her vitality's higher and she has a movement range of 4.\
\
\
(F) Yoshino "Haru" Harusawa\
    Age: 20\
    Email handle: n/a\
    Playable routes: none\
\
Haru's the lead vocalist for D-Va, an indie rock band. The band's on hiatus\
due to one of their members having left, but Haru still plays on the street\
during the lockdown. Music's her everything; \
\
She carries around a sequencer left to her by her teacher, but it seems to be\
more connected with demon summoning than anyone thought...\
\
While she's often a civilian that you'll have to protect during fights, no, she\
isn't a playable character. It's too bad. ): If she was a fighter, her eventual\
stats would've been incredible (best magic in the game, plus an insane amount\
of HP), too.\
\
\
(G) Eiji "Gin" Kamiya\
    Age: 25\
    Email handle: GIN\
    Playable routes: only Gin's\
\
Gin runs a bar in Omotesando, "Eiji," and acts as a guardian for Haru. Yuzu\
says that everyone thinks of him as a big brother figure of sorts. All he wants\
is for Tokyo to go back to the way it was - without demons - the vibrant,\
lively city that Aya loved and he grew to love as well.\
\
His lover went missing six months ago. Without her influence, he would've been\
a much different kind of guy. Searching for answers in the middle of the\
lockdown, Gin will need your help to find out just what happened to her and\
where she is.\
\
Gin's stats are probably the most balanced out of everyone's, leaning slightly\
towards strength and vitality. But yeah, incredibly balanced, which makes his\
skill range very diverse and allows him to provide good support. He has a\
movement range of 4 and a Speed of 52.\
\
\
(H) Tadashi "Kaido" Nikaido\
    Age: 19\
    Email handle: NIKAIDO\
    Playable routes: Kaido's, Naoya's\
\
Kaido's the well-known leader of the Shibuya Daemons, a "charismatic gang" of\
sorts. He doesn't really want to lead them, though, as to him some of the\
notions are a pain - but he does it for the sake of his older brother, the\
former leader. Kaido just wants the power to defend those important to him, \
and will do anything to get it.\
\
Kaido has high strength, much higher than Atsuro's, and higher vitality as\
well. However, he has low agility and basically nonexistant magic. He has a\
movement range of 4 and a Speed of 47. I honestly prefer Atsuro to him because\
of the former's better agility, magic defense, and versatility, but if you want\
brute strength, Kaido's your guy.\
\
\
(I) Yasuyuki Honda\
    Age: 29\
    Email handle: YASHON\
    Playable routes: none\
\
A typical Tokyo office worker - or is he? - Honda got stuck in the lockdown and\
desperately wants to get out to be at his son's side during his surgery. He\
becomes a companion of Kaido's. You'll cross paths with him several times,\
and perhaps even on some of the routes...\
\
\
(J) Mari Mochizuki\
    Age: 23\
    Email handle: n/a\
    Playable routes: all except Yuzu's\
\
An elementary school nurse, Mari was Atsuro's former tutor. She was childhood\
friends with Kaido and his brother. After the first of the bloodless killings,\
she's never been able to get over her companion's death. With the lockdown and\
the demons, she might be able to do something about it at last.\
\
Mari has slightly less magic and agility than Yuzu, but far more vitality. Her\
speed's 53 and she has a movement range of 4.\
\
\
(K) Amane Kuzuryu\
    Age: 16\
    Email handle: AMANE\
    Playable routes: Amane's, Gin's\
\
The daughter of the founder, the Shomonkai's maiden speaks with a charismatic\
gravitas that attracts people to the cause. However, she doesn't seem to agree\
entirely with everything the Shomonkai advocates, and she might also have a few\
beings - angelic, or demonic? - residing in her. With her strong belief in God,\
Amane really would like nothing better than for you to become the next Messiah,\
spread His teachings all over the world, and so on.\
\
Amane has a little more magic than Yuzu, but lower strength and far lower\
agility (it'll be a while before she can use Ma-dyne magic). More of a magic\
tank than a magic blitzer. She has a movement range of 3.\
\
\
(L) Azuma\
\
He's one of the top Shomonkai officials and Amane's protectors. Though he's\
little more than a member of the Shomonkai, he knows and caused a few things\
that at least one of your friends is desperate to know.\
\
\
(M) Founder\
\
Amane's father, the founder of Shomonkai seems to have a strong disagreement\
with his daughter about something important. His intentions and beliefs might\
be the cause of more than you could have guessed.\
\
\

She's a member of a special government unit deployed to deal with lockdown-\
related things. And, yeah, her mission's her priority - she'll kill you if\
she'll have to, considering all the lives on the line. Don't push it. She\
values the goals of the mission over pride or the usual tactics, so she'll\
provide you help and support when needed, sometimes.\
\
Izuna has impressive Strength, Vitality, and Agility. No magic whatsoever,\
though, but still easily one of the best physical fighters in the game. She has\
a movement of 4.\

Aka, the flashy gigolo guy. He seems to know Naoya, but never elucidates on why\
he does, or why he knows so much about the Bels and their war. He seems pretty\

\
If you manage to see the scene where Midori teaches a Jack Frost about the\
power of love and magical punishment, later on in the game you might get to\
encounter Black Frost, a souped-up Jack Frost who's trying to protect some of\
his fellow demons from getting slaughtered.\
\
Black Frost has pretty much balanced stats, leaning more towards magic, then\
strength. He has a movement of three. The main point in using him is that he\
has natural resistances - reflect to fire and ice. However, he's also weak to\
force.\

\
\{// A: Mission/battle system ............\
                                  .................................. [0602] //\}\
\
Devil Survivor is an SRPG, or strategy role-playing game. Missions have\
criteria for victory or defeat. You only have to meet one of the victory\
requirements to win; likewise, you only have to fail one of the defeat criteria\
to lose. The battles are turn-based and fought on grids peppered with different\
elevation levels and obstacles.\
\
On your character's turn, you can move, fight, use a skill that you or your\
demon has, return a demon to your inventory, or summon a new demon (you can do\
this to replace a demon whose HP went down to 0, too). Every action you take\
adds a little to your speed bar of sorts. The fuller it is (compared to\
everyone else's), the farther back your next turn will be in the order (which\
you can see in the little bar of characters at the top).\
\
Battles themselves are turn-based; choose which action you want (Attack, Guard,\
and up to three Command Skills), and fight. Turn order is based on agility.\
\
Victory requirements vary; sometimes you have to protect a civilian/civilians,\
sometimes you can't let one of your characters die (normally, if this happens,\
you can revive them again, but in some battles if they run out of HP, that's\
it), sometimes you'll only have to defeat a boss to win.\
\
   NOTE: Just going to stick this bit of advice here. If you're ever having\
         a really hard time with the game even if your team leaders' levels\
         are fine, it's because you forgot about your demons. Always keep\
         them up to date - that's why you can fuse. Demons level up much\
         slower than your team leaders, so keeping them around for a long\
         time is not viable.\
\
\
\{ // B: Extra Turn ......................\
                                  .................................. [0603] //\}\
\
Unique to the Megami Tensei series is the Extra Turn system. By hitting an\
enemy's elemental weakness or landing a critical hit, you'll give your fighter\
an "extra turn." After the initial turn, all characters who've scored the\
extra turn option will act once more in a second turn of sorts. In addition to\
scoring extra turns, you can make your opponents' extra turns disappear if you\
hit them with crits/weaknesses. Likewise, the same can happen to you.\
\
\
\{// C: Fighting stats ...................\
                                  .................................. [0604] //\}\
\
When you or a demon levels up, one of four possible stats that affect your\
performance in battle will increase. You can only choose which stats will\
increase when for the MC - all other characters' stat increases are\
predetermined.\
\
For characters in your party, stats also affect which types of skills they can\
equip.\
\
Strength: affects the strength of "Attack" and any physical damage-dealing\
          move.\
Magic:    affects the strength of any elemental MP-costing magic attack, and\
          the amount of MP a character has. Also factors into magic defense.\
Vitality: affects the amount of HP and physical defense a character has.\
Agility:  determines how soon a character will attack in battle, and the\
          likelihood of getting Extra Turns.\
\
Stats alone don't determine damage factors, as your level also plays a part in\
how much damage you deal and receive.\
\
\
\{// D: Recommended MC stats? ............\
                                  .................................. [0605] //\}\
\
It depends. Yeah, cheap answer, I know. Most players favor a Main with high\
Magic, as you'll have the ability to wipe out most things on your own later on\
in the game. A magic nuke with high mag and agi could wipe out most things on\
the first turn and take advantage of Almighty skills, for example.\
\
If it's your first playthrough, personally, I would advise you to raise your\
strength more in the beginning, as you won't have many skills cracked for your\
Magic stat to take advantage of (one of the reasons why Yuzu's not quite as\
useful in the beginning, but can be a monster later on). Still, after a day or\
so, you don't have to bother with it so much. Decide which passives you want\
your MC to equip - Null Phys, for example, requires 13 Str. Null Fire, good for\
the Day 6 18:00 fight, requires 11 Str.\
\
And by the time you get to 2nd/3rd Day or so, you should be liberally raising\
Magic whenever possible.\
\
Personally, I favor agility in whatever game I play. Watch the monsters you\
fight to see if you're increasing it too much, though - after a certain point\
it's unnecessary.\
\
I know I've neglected to say anything about Vitality. I never really bothered\
with it unless I needed a certain skill equipped.\
\
So, in short: magic, agility, strength/vitality. If you want to play it safer,\
go more vitality than agility. Just don't keep your stats 100% balanced -\
by the end you'll be too flimsy in Strength or Magic to do what Atsuro and\
Yuzu can with Deathbound and -dyne spells, and you'll have other balanced\
characters who can take care of skill versatility in your party.\
\
And you -can- play as a strength-oriented MC. But since you have Atsuro (and\
Kaido, and Izuna, and Gin, potentially) and there are more magic skills/setups\
than phys. ones, it's honestly not the best choice.\
\
\
\{// E: Skills ...........................\
                                  .................................. [0606] //\}\
\
Devil Survivor has no items or whatnot. The only way for you to do anything is\
with skills. They'll let you attack, defend, up resistance, whatever. Your\
character's stats determine which skills they can equip.\
\
Towards the middle of the 1st Day, you gain the ability to Skill Crack, aka get\
the abilities of demons you defeat. You have to select which skill you want and\
have that specific character defeat that specific demon. Obviously, you can't\
crack two skills off of one individual demon during a battle, and only one\
Skill Crack per character per battle.\
\
Note that you don't have to have the stats to equip a specific skill to be able\
to crack it.\
\
As the game states, you don't have to crack a skill with a certain character to\
have them use it; just go to the menu and directly choose who uses what (Y\
button).\
\
There are four types of skills in the game: Command, Passive, Racial, and Auto.\
\
Command: lets you take action in battle (i.e. magic, phys. attack, healing,\
         status effects, defense/reflect/null attacks).\
Passive: primarily defense/support oriented (i.e. elemental resistances,\
         increased crit rates, possible status infliction, 2x attack).\
Racial:  demons only. Each demon race (Fairy, Kishin, Jaki, Gemna...) has a\
         unique ability (i.e. increased movement/attack range, ranged healing,\
         MP recovery, crit rate increase.)\
Auto:   tamers only. Kicks in at the beginning of/during battle (i.e. increased\
         evade/attack/defense, halved MP cost, healing, null element attack).\
\
\
\{// F: Macca bonus/magnetite ............\
                                  .................................. [0607] //\}\
\
Early in the game, these two elements are unlocked. Macca bonus is, well, what\
it sounds like - a monetary bonus you get at the end of each particular fight/\
skirmish with a demon team within a battle. Magnetite allows you to assign one\
of the demons on your team a skill that you've cracked, once you build up\
enough of it. Command skills only - no passives allowed, alas.\
\
Both are influenced by how well you fight in battle. The more seamlessly and\
efficiently you fight, the better your bonus, and the more your magnetite 'bar'\
gets charged.\
\
Note that there's no way to look up the magnetite level of your characters.\
Eventually, you'll get a little message saying it's full. Fight more\
efficiently, and it'll come around more often. That's all there is to it.\

=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=\
\
\{// A: Timed events .....................\
                                  .................................. [0702] //\}\
\
In Devil Survivor, you move from location to location via a list of areas in\
the Yamanote circle. There's no movement cost, but if you choose an event, 30\
minutes will pass. Events have little clock symbols next to them, and areas \
with possible events have the same clock symbol, so you can't miss them.\
\
\
\{// B: Plot, battles and routes .........\
                                  .................................. [0703] //\}\
\
Battles are only one kind of event that makes time pass; events where you speak\
with various characters are another. Some of these events are required; most\
go toward unlocking one of the game's six possible character-oriented routes. \
Choosing one event will usually lead to another appearing on the map.\
\
It's possible to unlock all six routes in one playthrough (there's a guide you\
can find by searching the boards if you want a walkthrough). However, you can\
only do one route per playthrough, anyway, and the decision only kicks in on\
the 7th and final day).\
\
Again, any kind of battle shows up with a red "!", next to both its name and\
the area's name in the list. Free battles take up no time.\
\
The possible routes are as follows:\
\
   Amane\
   Atsuro\
   Gin\
   Kaido\
   Naoya\
   Yuzu\
\
Kaido's and Naoya's routes are more or less the same, following the King of\
Demons path.\
\
Yuzu's path is a default path. No matter what you do, it'll be available.\
\
   NOTE: In addition to events, there's a bit of a point system that\
         tallies up additional things like how you answer dialogue\
         choices. This system - aka, how you answer dialogue, does affect\
         which routes get unlocked as well. Just picking all the events\
         applicable to a route will not unlock it.\
\
\
\{// C: Blue events ......................\
                                  .................................. [0704] //\}\
\
One final note - blue events don't show up on your area list, and don't take up\
time. They usually supply extra information or something that'll help you get\
one of the routes, however, so you'll have to keep an eye out for them.\
\
\
\{// D. Which route should I...? .........\
                                  .................................. [0705] //\}\
\
Seems like a lot of first-time players really want to know the answer to this\
one. There's obviously no one, perfect answer, but here's a few ideas.\
\
 - Beat the game on Yuzu's route. You'll get all the bonuses of New Game+\
   (sans the movement range of 5 for the MC) and unlock several fusions that\
   will make the other routes more manageable. This route is the easiest.\
   In all the other routes, -you have to fight all/most of the Bels, the Devas,\
   and Babel-. So unless you really don't want to play this game twice, I'd\
   recommend Yuzu's route first to save yourself the grindfest.\
 - Otherwise, Atsuro's and Amane's will be moderate challenges.\
 - Despite the hype, the following are doable: go for Gin's or Naoya's/Kaido's\
   routes. Hard? Yes. Grindfest at times? Maybe. Final/penultimate levels make\
   you want to tear your hair out? Maybe. But they're not impossible...just\
   drastically easier (and not as time-intensive) on New Game+.\
\
Overall, don't freak out about it. If you're really bent on not replaying this\
game, then...well, why are you limiting yourself? New Game+ goes by a lot\
faster, as it's designed to help you see more options you naturally couldn't\
get to the first time while reducing grind time.\
\
Anyway, done opinionating. Carry on.\
\
\
\{// E. Last Day comparisons .............\
                                  .................................. [0706] //\}\
\
For a more specific (and obviously spoilery) rundown of just what the different\
Last Days for each route entails, battle-wise, look below.\
\
Events-wise, Atsuro's and Gin's are scene-heavy. Yuzu's is...almost entirely\
scenes. You can fight the optional, very difficult boss battle during all\
routes except Yuzu's, if you're on New Game+.\
\
Amane\
 - Jezebel\
 - Bishamon, Koumoku, Zouchou\
 - Belzebub\
 - Naoya; Loki (aka, two annoyingly powerful Megidolaon users)\
 - Belberith\
 - Babel\
   -- Bel gauntlet - refighting all the past Bels (including Beldr and Belial)\
\
Atsuro\
 - Naoya (try to catch him, he runs all over the place)\
 - Bishamon, Koumoku, Zouchou\
 - Belzebub\
 - Belberith\
 - Babel\
   -- Phase one - You'll have to escort someone who's not defenseless but lacks\
      a demon team. Atsuro is required, and will be out of commission for the\
      last half (once you access the console)\
   -- Phase two - Three Gate/elemental forms\
\
Gin\
 - Jezebel\
 - Bishamon, Koumoku, Zouchou\
 - Belzebub\
 - Belberith\
 - Babel\
   -- Phase one - You'll have to escort someone who's entirely defenseless.\
      Atsuro is required, and will be out of commission for the last half (once\
      you access the console)\
   -- Phase two - Three Gate/elemental forms...and, most of all, your demons\
      are all gone - yep, your team leaders fight this one solo (Babel's level\
      and resistance do go down slightly, though)\
\
Kaido/Naoya\
 - Believers, Amane (a huge Evil/Chaos Wave'ing horde)\
 - Jezebel\
 - Bishamon, Koumoku, Zouchou\
 - Belzebub\
 - Aniels, Kazfiels, Sariel, Anael\
 - Belberith\
 - Babel\
   -- Bel gauntlet - refighting all the past Bels (including Beldr and Belial)\

=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=\
\
Like some other SMT games, after you beat it the first time, you can create\
a New Game+ file. When you play the game again, you'll get the following:\
\
 - All Skill Cracks carry over.\
 - All Macca carries over.\
 - All demons carry over. (Yeah, no joke.)\
 - Your auction rating carries over (and with it, auction levels - Gold, etc).\
 - Unlocked fusions carry over.\
 - The level limit for fusions is no more.\
 - There will be no experience penalty where you get less EXP from defeating\
   lower-level demons. Basically, grinding? Becomes a lot easier and less\
   time-consuming. If you even need to.\
 - The character whose route you beat appears on the title screen.\
   (If you beat Kaido's route, you'll unlock Naoya's picture. And if you beat\
    Gin's route, you'll get Gin and Haru's pictures.)\
 - There's an optional boss on the Last Day.\
\
Also, the MC can get certain boosts:\
 - If you beat Yuzu's route, you'll start with a movement of 4 and Speed of 53.\
 - If you beat any other route, you'll start with a movement of 5 and Speed of\
   56.\
 - These don't stack (i.e. you beat the game twice, you won't have 59-62 Speed\
   or a movement of 6 or whatever).\
\
Yeah, without New Game+, enjoying all the different endings wouldn't be quite\
as easy or fun. And it's so awesome to see your endgame demons deal around\
3,000 damage to the beginning demons...\
\
Anyway, here's where the game begins.\
\
\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
A note on the guide structure:\
\
For the rest of the days, the info I have will be split up into an events\
section (A), which goes through the events you have access to etc etc, and a\
battle section (B), which details all the storyline battles you'll fight that\
day.\
\
I'm not including free battles. It's information that I don't think most people\
will need - if the enemies are challenging (especially for the non-hard free\
battle), you're doing something wrong with your battle strategy/team setups,\
not paying attention to weaknesses, etc. The rule of thumb is, fight enough of\
them per day so that you can skill crack everything available to you.\
\
\
The events section will vary depending on what you choose in the game. For\
example, say the schedule lists a Gin event on Day 3, but you don't choose it.\
The event will carry over into the next day, etc etc, but I'm not listing that\
event under the Day 4 event flowchart. I'm trying to only list events that\
appear for the first time on that day, but this system isn't perfect and the\
locations of events might change (this happened to me with Honda once), so bear\
with me.\
\
Also, one kinda important pre-game reminder, again:\
\
     Your dialogue choices in the game? Important. In addition to various\
     specific ones that influence major plot points, a lot of it will affect\
     the routes you can get on the 6th Day. Keep it in mind.\

It doesn't really matter which of the first two events you pick. I never chose\

The demons start off by attacking. Just attack, really nothing to it. If you're\
having problems right now, well, I'm not sure. The MC and Atsuro should have no\
problems with their battles, while Yuzu's might take a little longer. Let her\
defeat her demon, though, for the EXP.\
\
You'll earn about 35 EXP and 50 Macca at the end.\
\
After the battle, you'll be able to see people's death clocks.\
\
Leaving the current setup of Pixie - Yuzu, Kobold - Main, and Kabuso - Atsuro\
should work fine. Same with skills (Dia, Agi, and Zio).\

Don't freak out about the Wendigo. The Priestess's turn comes before it, and\
one Maragi from her will reduce its HP to 1, causing it to flee the battle.\
She'll also give chase, leaving the EXP and fightable enemies to you.\
\
Again, this battle shouldn't be too hard. Take care of the Pixie before it\
heals anyone, spam Agi (on the Pixie and Kobolds) and Zio (on the Ogres), and\
have Yuzu and Pixie heal if necessary.\
\
You'll earn about 50 EXP and 150 Macca at the end.\

Now is a good idea to fight free battles to keep up your party's level, and,\
when you get the ability, to Skill Crack. Fighting enough free battles until\
you crack everything you can should be enough to keep you leveled up.\

\
\
A lot of people seem to have trouble with this battle, but it can be pretty\
straightforward if you take the right steps. First, all of your teams should\
have two demons each. As you just received Skill Crack, you should go and fight\
a free battle or two at Shibuya until you've cracked everything you can, which\
will give you skills and EXP.\
\
Next, you absolutely do not want to get swarmed or separate your teams. It'll\
hurt. Take care of the Waira and Kabuso teams to your immediate bottom-right.\
Don't advance towards Wendigo until that's done.\
\
You'll want to crack Wendigo's Anti-Ice as it's handy to have this early. I\
used Yuzu as my main attacker, and put Agi and Zan on her. Gang up on Wendigo\
and kill the Moh Shuyuu first with Zan before they get in the way. Constantly\
heal with Dia and Charm. At this point my MC had slightly higher strength, so I\
let him attack while saving his MP for Dia. Or you can put Dia on Yuzu and Zan\
on the MC, whichever way works best. As you probably know by now, your Pixie's\
rather fragile, so be careful with it.\
\
Once you get Wendigo down to maybe 1/3 HP, it'll start running away. It can't\
run off the field, though, so don't worry about it \'96 pursue it leisurely (or\
Bind it with Ogre if you must), and Wendigo will eventually double back. At\
least, that's what happened when I fought it. Don't forget about the demons\
that start behind it, either, especially the Pixie with Charm/Dia. You probably\
want to kill those quickly \'96 if you kill Wendigo first, some of them will leave\
the battle. Might as well get the EXP while you can, right?\
\
Since you can't fuse yet and have limited options, just be at a good level,\
move cautiously, and you should be okay.\
\
You'll receive about 100 EXP and 70 Macca at the end.\

\
\
This is pretty much your first taste of a save-the-civilian sort of battle.\
In short, it'd be a good idea to have demons in your teams that have Devil\
Speed, Animal Leg, etc, that'll give you more movement. Basically, having a\
Waira or two would really help things out. Having a Pixie with Charm will also\
be helpful, in case you need to heal Haru.\
\
So. Have two members work on taking out enemies close by, and at the same time,\
have someone with Devil Speed rush over to Haru. You'll have about two or three\
turns before the Waira team by her significantly weakens her and you'll really\
need to heal her. And watch out for the pesky Bilwis team at the top left - it\
has two Jakis that can Bind you and lower your movement to 1 if you get within\
three spaces of it.\
\
You'll receive about 110 EXP and 85 Macca at the end.\

Hm, more standard fare. The battle introduces the red demon-generating squares,\
but they don't really pump out any reinforcements in this battle. You can stand\
on them and pick up the COMPs causing them if you want, but as it's a waste of\
time, don't bother.\
\
The Bilwis teams won't move unless you get maybe within 1-2 spaces of them. The\
Waira team, on the other hand, is all too happy to use Devil Speed to get to\
you. Standard battling strategies apply here - don't get ganged up on, slowly\
and methodically eliminate teams, hit weaknesses, etc etc. If you think a lone\
team's strong enough to take on a Bilwis team on its own, by all means;\
otherwise, mass them in a big group.\

You'll receive about 140 EXP and 105 Macca at the end.\

Nearly all of the teams are made up of a pair of the same demon, so they'll\
have the same weaknesses. Take advantage of it and stack your teams accordingly\
with the right elemental spells (especially if you have any Ma- or Dance ones).\
\
There's one tamer with Evil Wave who can attack you from two squares away.\
Luckily, you can reach him in the first turn and take out his Toubyou partner,\
keeping him from doing so.\
\
The best thing about this battle is that it's a tamer battle, meaning you have\
the opportunity to crack Auto Skills. For this battle (and all others), you'll\
want to prioritize Auto Skill cracking since they're relatively rare. Thus, get\
all three of the ones you can find here while you can.\

show up, though, so it's not a big deal.\
\
There's not much to this battle. The three Gagyson teams won't move or attack,\
so eliminate them at will. It'll be easier to get to the first Gagyson behind\
the railing near where you start out if you have someone with Phantasma or\
Flight, if you want this to go quicker.\

\
This battle shouldn't be too challenging. What might be harder is grabbing as\
much EXP as you can before Kaido and Honda take it all. They should be quite a\
few levels higher than you, and won't have a problem with the map. So, race\
over there and wipe out what you can.\
\
Reinforcements will spawn once in a while at the corners of the map. They're\
all random assortments of Gagyson teams, but they shouldn't be too bad. The\
biggest threat in this level is probably the Toubyous with Evil Wave, and the\
swarms of Jack Frosts and Lilims who'll use Charm and Devotion. Again, it\
shouldn't be too much trouble - keep some Bufu and Agi spells in reserve, hit\
the Toubyous quickly, and you'll be done.\

Oh, look, the first of many save-the-civilian battles to come. And if you think\
this one's a pain...well, the others probably won't get any better. Unless you\
approach them strategically.\
\
With all save-civilian battles, abilities that'll let you get to where they are\
quickly will save the day. So, Devil Speed, Switch, and even Flight and\
Phantasma (which reduces wait time if you're just moving around) to a degree\
will help. You -can- Switch with NPCs, so that makes it easy to a) get to one\
end of the map quickly and b) get the civilians closer to the exit. Bind will\
stop enemies from being able to follow fleeing civilians, as well.\
\
You'll also want ranged mass-heal abilities like Charm, Devotion, or Affection.\
The civilians will ultimately end up getting damaged a little, and if you can't\
Switch them or defeat the enemies in one turn, you'll want to heal them. The\
requirement "A citizen dies" does not mean the team of three civilians - if a\
single one of them goes down to 0 HP, it's game over. So keep that in mind.\
\
So, for this battle, Devil Speed/Switch your way down the bridge. The Gagyson\
team has Devil Speed, so you'll want to go after it first. Heal the civilians,\
kill any demon team that tries to escape at the top, and the hardest part of\
this will be over soon enough.\
\
You'll receive about 260 EXP and 150 Macca at the end.\

Keisuke might pose a slight problem here, as he's apt to get swarmed and, well,\
die. So you're going to have to rush over to him, keep him healed, and take\
everything out. Midori will keep moving towards the underground escape tile,\
so if you keep things from getting too close to her, she should be okay.\
\
The usual strategy of Devil Speed/Flight applies (Switch isn't as helpful as\
he's not an escaping civilian, though you could preserve more EXP this way).\
All of the Evil Wave-ing Toubyous will start to get really annoying really\
soon, so gang up on them to kill them asap.\

\
Welcome to the most nonsensical battle of the game. In short, make your way up\
the steps (with something like Devil Speed, Flight, or Phantasma, preferably),\
and have all of your party members stand next to one COMP. Don't analyze just\
yet. As Ghost Q said at the beginning, it's a game \'96 two of the containers are\
fake, and one's real. If you get a fake one, which seems to happen for the\
first two containers all the time, a Ghost Q will replace the container. At\
your current level, yeah, you could get slaughtered.\
\
If your party analyzes in one go, you should be able to evade damage. The other\
option is to spend a turn standing next to the containers, then analyze. You'll\
then be able to move, and the Ghost Qs won't pursue you if you're not in their\
range. Strange, but yes.\
\
The real container has 999 Macca in it, though you could get other prizes too\
such as Skill Cracks and the like.\
\
Overall, this isn't really a battle worth fighting \'96 you can get the EXP and\
Macca through free battles, you can't crack anything off of Ghost Q, and it\
uses up a precious 30 minutes that you could be using to get yourself on\
another route. Don't bother.\
\
I got 20 EXP as the end battle bonus. I assume that if you defeat Ghost Q you\
could get more, but then you'll miss out on the Macca...which was the point,\
right?\

With Haru way up on the stage and all the monsters much closer to her than you\
are to them, yeah, it'll be a race. The usual save-the-civilian strategies\
apply, and Devil Speed, Flight, and Phantasm will be incredibly useful here.\
Actually, I doubt you'll be able to make it on time without them. You'll also\
want a ranged healing ability for Haru's sake, as a demon or two will probably\
get to her first.\
\
Otherwise, that's about it. You've got a lot of annoying Toubyou with Evil Wave\
and enemy teams that can usually be taken out with either Ma-/Dance Bufu- or\
Agi-type skills, so take advantage of those weaknesses. And be wary of the\
Wendigos' Bind, as it can be quite irritating if you don't take them out.\

You'll receive about 360 EXP and 210 Macca at the end.\

\
Not too bad a battle at first. Race towards the civilians and Midori with the\
usual Devil Speed/Flight/Switch options, heal them as needed, let the civilians\
escape southwards, etc etc.\
\
The fun part's when you kill all the demons, as Beldr emerges from the ground\
in some...strange metal-adorned fashion, and unleashes Vampire Mist. It targets\
everyone on the field and does Mystic-type damage that'll partially heal him.\
And he's a bit immortal (note that racial skill and those Nulls, there), so you\
really have no choice but to run. He's got a move of 3, so if you have someone\
Bind him once or twice, there really shouldn't be any problem.\
\
Beldr appears at the top of the field, so you can arrange your team accordingly\
so that most of them are out of harm's way. You -will- have to fight Beldr once\
to find out his immortal-ness for yourself, though. Letting Midori attack him\
will work - you'll just have to cover for her a little more, as your teams\
can't escape before she does. The reinforcements are fairly high-\
leveled, so don't underestimate them. If they're too tough, just flee asap.\
\
\
You'll receive about 400 EXP and 240 Macca at the end.\

The monsters will ignore you in favor of Midori and the lone citizen, so run on\

another good battle for multi-strike skills that hit weaknesses, so.\
\
This is an optional battle. It's required for unlocking Black Frost (the event\
with the Frost doesn't appear until after this battle), so yeah, up to you.\
Note that you can only use Black Frost on Naoya's and Amane's routes.\

\
Okay, this battle's a little more unique. There are seven enemy teams in all -\
the Yuki Jyorou team appears after a turn or so - and you'll have to defeat\
four of them if you don't want to lose the mission and your COMPs, thanks to\
that challenge that Yuzu made. Kaido and Honda get to attack first, plus their\
attacks more often than not target the leaders, meaning they'll quickly rack up\
kills.\
\
You might as well restart the battle if Honda kills the first enemy team all on\
his own, as catchup could be tricky. If Kaido uses Double Hit, he'll get pushed\
way down in the attack order and you won't have to worry about him moving for a\
while. Flight/Phantasm/Devil Speed your way up the map. If you're having\
serious speed issues, aim for the team leaders only - that's all that counts.\
\
The Yuki Jyorou reinforcement appears on the lower level where the Pyro Jack\
is, so you'll want someone with Flight to go down there, or just someone who'll\
go down the stairs at the start. You'll probably be able to kill those teams\
before Kaido ever manages to get down there, so if you can kill two other\
teams, you're set.\
\
Whenever you kill four teams, Kaido and Honda will be swept out of the battle\
and you get to take care of whatever demons are left at your own leisurely\
pace.\
\
You'll receive about 410 EXP and 270 Macca at the end.\

Hey, another one of those rare tamer battles, providing Blitzkrieg and Fortify\
free(-ish) for the taking. The former ups attack by 25% and the latter defense\
by 25%, so you want those skills.\
\
Nearly all of the teams should be reachable in your first turn. If you have\
someone with Flight or Devil Speed, you'll be able to get to the teams on the\
left. You might want to get rid of those first, as 1) Chaos Wave is a pain and\
2) allies will appear after two enemy teams have been killed/two turns have\
gone by/something like that. And you know how irritating it is when someone\
else kills what you're trying to Skill Crack.\
\
You'll earn about 450 EXP and 310 Macca at the end.\

The tamers will go after the demons first. Be careful when fighting them - once\
defeated, they'll become civilians that can die and make you fail the mission.\
So, you'll want to eliminate most of the demons first. Shouldn't be too much of\
a problem as they're all closer to you anyway.\
\
The real annoyance in this battle's from the tamer teams, as two of them have\
Chaos Wave. You can let the demons weaken them or whatever if you're having\
trouble with that.\
\
You'll earn about 490 EXP and 330 Macca at the end.\

Oh yeah. This is a fun battle. Actually, it's not that hard if you come in with\
the right demons and the right level. You should be at level 26+ for this\
battle, because you can then fuse Kishin Nalagiri. This is necessary for the\
MC, as Nalagiri's Double Hit will allow you to attack Beldr twice per turn.\
Since the MC's the one with the devil's fuge and he's the only one that can\
thus do damage...you'll want him to attack as much as possible. Give him a\
Dragon-type with Evil Wave and you could fight Beldr without taking damage most\
of the time, even. But you probably want the Extra Turns, so...unless you're\
really dying, don't.\
\
Also, if you have Anti-Mystic, put it on the MC for a few reasons. Beldr's\
Vampire Mist, which hits everyone on the field, is Mystic-type, so you won't\
take as much damage. (Using demons with St/Nu Mystic would be a good idea, but\
Vampire Mist comes around maybe once every four turns, so it's up to you.) The\
second, Beldr has +Stone, and the last thing you want is your MC - the only one\
who can do damage to him - to get petrified. Grr argh and all that.\
\
So. Make your way carefully towards Beldr, and try to gang up on the demon\
teams. Get rid of the ones with Evil Wave asap. Have the MC attack Beldr while\
keeping everyone else out of his range - Beldr will move to attack someone else\
if you give him the opportunity. Not good.\
\
Oh, one more thing, about the reinforcements. At a late point in the battle (at\
least, it should be late, or you might be screwed), Beldr will literally revive\
all the demon teams you've killed thus far. Very, very fun.\
\
So, in short. Budget yourself for at least one Vampire Mist healing Beldr by\
180 HP or so. Keep your party together and very healed, and out of Beldr's\
range. Double Hit Beldr into oblivion. At level 26+ with Nalagiri, provided\
that you haven't neglected the rest of your team, this honestly shouldn't be as\
hard as it's reputed to be.\
\
You'll earn about 540 EXP and 370 Macca at the end.\

No skills to crack, and no demons to fight? This is a joke, right? Or not.\
Shifting victory requirements, shifting enemies, shifting allies...fun, fun,\
fun. This battle can be complicated if you don't know what's coming.\
\
Whichever victory requirement you choose, you'll have to chase away the\
civilians. Midori doesn't fight back, but they shouldn't be able to take her\
down. Damage one citizen team, but only slightly (one physical hit from Yuzu or\
something should do it), as you still can't kill them. They'll realize you're\
tamers and flee north.\
\
Once you do that, Keisuke appears on the north end with a huge chip on his\
shoulder. To him, injustice should be punished, and he's the punisher. Or more\
specifically, the "objective" judge of the underworld is \'96 don't you love it\
when people excuse their actions because they're acting by an "objective"\
moral standard?\
\
This new demon companion, Yama, stands by himself on the battlefield. As it\
wields multi-target attacks with the ability to attack twice per turn at level\
45, you don't want to mess with it. (Unless you're on New Game+.) It has a\
movement range of 2, so if you're careful, it shouldn't be able to kill you.\
\
A new escape route opens up south for the civilians, so here's the strategy.\
Send someone up to Midori and choose [persuade], and she'll escape through the\
underground exit. Quickly send someone really strong towards Keisuke and take\
him out, preferably in one blow. Or do it out of his demon buddy's range, as\
he'll kill your team in one blow. Once you defeat Keisuke, Yama leaves with\
him, which makes this battle much easier. (Defeating Yama will make Keisuke\
leave the battle, as well.)\
\
When you or the citizens approach the south exit, several demons appear. Just\
a few Noas, but nothing serious. Kill them quickly, though they don't\
necessarily prioritize citizens.\
\
The next priority's to catch up with Keisuke, but don't forget what happens at\
17:00...\
\
You'll receive about 670 EXP and 410 Macca at the end.\

Hey, it's a tamer battle. Only the one auto skill to crack, but it's a nice\
one. At the same time, Battle Aura's one of the most annoying things about this\
fight, so here goes.\
\
Protect the civilian by rushing in with Devil Speed/Switch/etc and healing him\
when necessary. Kill the thugs, especially the teams with Basilisks first. Snag\
the nice skill cracks.\
\
Admittedly, Battle Aura could make this fight pretty annoying. If you really\
can't get around it, Drain the leader's MP to keep it from kicking in.\
Otherwise, keep attacking with your strongest moves and targeting weaknesses,\
as that should do over 50 damage (even though Battle Aura's description says\
it nullifies damage > 50, it seems to be the opposite).\
\
Once you eliminate most of the tamers, they'll start to flee. Bind if you must,\
but they have low movement and should be easy to defeat.\
\
You'll receive about 720 EXP and 470 Macca at the end.\

\
\
A horde of civilians surround Kaido and Honda, though it looks like Kaido's\
snapped. He's going to kill everyone, unless you can stop them. Whatever you\
choose at the beginning, you'll have to defeat both tamers to get through the\
battle. Kaido has an attack range of three and Honda has a movement of four,\
plus they're both way down south.\
\
So. Basically, use your Devil Speed/Switch (very helpful here)/etc strategies\
to rush over. You might as well send one team along the skinny right-side path\
to get to Honda, while everyone else can gang up on Kaido while keeping all the\
civilians alive or whatnot. Chaos Wave will be annoying, but not a huge threat.\
Take note that a couple of strong magic users will quickly finish Kaido's team\
off.\

Other:\
Mari Lv: 41\
\
\
You stumble upon Mari, who's cornered by Kudlak. Mari tells you to run away and\
leave Kudlak alone, and also asks you which way's the best way out. You have\
the choice of going down the stairs, or around the park. Whatever you say,\
she'll choose to go around the park.\
\
Mari also warns you not to kill Kudlak. This one's up to you. You'll have to\
encounter Kudlak one more time, and in that fight, Mari has to deal the\
finishing blow. If you don't kill him this time, he'll still be level 35 next\
time, and easy enough for you to weaken and Mari to defeat. If you do kill him,\
he'll be at level 46 with a new set of (more powerful) moves. If Mari can't\
deal the finishing blow in the next battle, she'll die. Leaving him at level 35\
makes that fight a bit easier, but a level 46 Kudlak isn't unmanageable (though\
Mari will only be able to deal maybe 20 damage to him, making the level a bit\
harder). Again, up to you.\
\
Ah, one more thing. Not only can you not defeat Kudlak, but you can't kill the\
Loa with him, either. Even if you leave Kudlak alive, he'll still be level 46\
if you took out the Loa, I'm pretty sure.\
\
If you have someone with Flight, you can get to the middle of the park quickly.\
Set up two others with Devil Speed to go west around the park, and let someone\
follow Kudlak's group up the stairs if you want. Having someone with Bind\
following Kudlak or someone ready to Switch with Mari on the left side will\
make this go a little quicker. Mari won't die - if anything, she'll easily kill\
other demon teams whose EXP you want - so don't worry about her even though the\
demons will target her. Level 41 and all that.\
\
If you let Mari escape, at the end you'll get two options: "Chase Mari down,"\
or "Save your own lives." Whichever one you pick, the battle will end. And no,\
your choice doesn't affect anything (I have no idea why it's there).\
\
You'll receive about 850 EXP and 570 Macca at the end.\

Hey, a tamer battle...with the police. Fun stuff. You might want to crack Ares\
Aid and Alter Pain most especially, as you won't run into a Mahakala or that\
auto skill very often.\
\
Anyway, you have three civilians strewn about and no escape route for them to\
take, so you'll have to fight quickly, brutally, and efficiently. Shouldn't be\
hard, as you should be able to reach most of the cops on your first turn. If\
you're having trouble keeping the civilians alive, use Bind or target the party\
leaders only. Shouldn't be too difficult.\
\
You'll receive about 900 EXP and 620 Macca at the end.\

It kicks off with a big red swirl in the sky, and a ton of events. Not a bad\

You've got some new auto skills to crack, but other than that and how you have\
to go against a few crazed soldiers, it's nothing special. You'll start in a\

\
\
...Yeah, higher-level Kudlak has less HP. It's just that he'll do more damage,\
take less damage, etc etc, so it's up to you which incarnation of him you want\
to fight. I think I had an easier time against lv.53 than my friend did versus\
lv.46, but both are quite defeatable.\
\
Whether Mari lives or dies, your strategy should only change slightly. The\
other demons aren't really a threat, though they can kill Kaido if you don't\
take care of them first. The problem lies with Kudlak, who is rather annoying\
depending on the stupid RNG/luck of the draw. Weaken him first, Bind him, and\
leave it to Mari while you fight everything else. (I had the MC pretty much\
whittle his HP down to near nothing so she could deal the final blow.) The\
demons will especially go after her and Kaido (if he's there), so try to\
weaken/defeat them first and have some healing abilities on hand.\
\
Again, the ridiculous RNG makes all the difference. Mari will more often than\
not deal only 20-30 damage (usually 20), and will suffer a great deal of\
damage. Sometimes she'll deal closer to 120. Again, it's mostly luck. If you're\
fighting the higher-level Kudlak...it's still luck. So, yes, if the RNG has\
decided to absolutely hate you, you're going to have to either weaken Kudlak\
very, very precisely, or you're going to have to Petrify him. You'll want to\
suspend your file when you've succeeded - once, Mari somehow managed to deal no\
damage, took 120 damage, and allowed Kudlak to heal over 200 HP, which was fun.\
\
Either way, Mari has to deal the finishing blow. Otherwise, Kudlak will\
reincarnate himself yet again, and that time he'll be too strong for Mari, and\
she'll die.\
\
If Mari's already dead (because you chose the battle too late), then just kill\
Kudlak yourself. Without Kresnik around, he has no more interest in this\
country, and will wander off.\
\
Also, the enemies really like Kaido; probably three of them'll swarm him on the\
first turn. Urgh. He'll probably survive, but you might want to have someone\
Devil Speed over or whatever, just in case.\
\
If Mari dealt the final blow to Kudlak, you'll unlock Kudlak's and Kresnik's\
fusions - a Jaki and a Genma - in the Cathedral of Shadows.\
\
You'll receive about 1200 EXP and 800 Macca at the end.\

\
For reasons I haven't quite figured out yet, you might get dialogue with Atsuro\
at the beginning where he'll ask, "Maybe we can BS our way through this and\
find a way to convince him later?" You can agree or say it's the wrong idea. If\
you agree and pick the right options in the next dialogue, Midori will leave\
and Keisuke will join, Yama won't kill the cops, and you won't have to fight.\
Plus, you'll have to fight against Midori and Kaido in an upcoming battle.\
Thus, don't agree with Atsuro and fight the battle to retain all your party\
members, earn more EXP, and get skill cracks.\
\
Oh, and yes, BS'ing the battle will seal off Kaido's route since you'll have to\
fight him in the future and destroy his COMP.\
\
Basically, protect the civilians, target the tamers, and defeat Yama. When you\
defeat the tamers, they'll be left with 150 HP. so make sure they aren't in\
Keisuke's range when you defeat them.\
\
Annoyingly, you can't defeat Keisuke, as it's the equivalent of killing him.\
You can get rid of the rest of his team and mute or petrify him, though, to\
give yourself a breather, as he will keep attacking you otherwise.\
\
Yama's the really fun part. Try to have demons with resistance to fire or phys,\
as his attacks will feel quite brutal. Evil Wave will keep you from taking\
damage and help weaken him, as well, and you can try to Mute him to stop those\
frustrating fire attacks of his. (Or Petrify him if you can, as that'll end it\
quickly.) He seems to mostly follow Keisuke around and doesn't usually initiate\
fights, as well. As long as you're careful, you should be fine.\
\
After his defeat, Yama, a Deity type, can then be fused in the Cathedral of\
Shadows. Keisuke will also rejoin your party.\
\
You'll receive about 1130 EXP and 740 Macca at the end.\

\
If you didn't hand the bag to Kaido and chose to save Mari, or you were late\
for whatever reason, you'll see Kaido's Pazuzu kill Keisuke and have to fight\
them right then and there. Most of the demons are the same old and won't pose\
much of a threat, but swarms of them plus Kaido plus Pazuzu...well.\
\
You might want to kill as many of the Mothman teams as you can and/or get\
within their normal range, to prevent them from using Devil Speed and getting\
that +15 initiative, as it'll hurt. Combined with the Evil Wave-using Yms, pace\
yourself and your teams.\
\
Note that you don't have to defeat Pazuzu, but the experience would be pretty\
nice. Evil Wave's the main problem, so just move towards him and Kaido very\
carefully while being sure of their attack range. Swarm Pazuzu with several\
teams, then go after Kaido. No problem.\

It's not in the victory requirements, but if you want to beat six demons in one\
turn or less, you'll have to have a precise strategy. The turn thing only\
applies to the number of turns the MC takes. Thus, if you can put him as far\
back in the turn rotation as possible, your other teammates will be able to\
kill enough teams for you to win. A Kishin's Double Up is the best way to do\
this; other movement racial skills and healing will also push your next turn\
back. There are seven demons in all, so if you can eliminate the five teams to\
the left and one of the Badb Catha teams, you're all set. Those five will\
actively move towards you and attack; the Badb Catha teams are less reliable in\
that regard, but if you get close enough, they'll move a little.\
\
If you want to win in one turn: put Double Up on the MC. Have him go towards\
the Loa. Someone with Devil Speed can reach the northernmost Orobas, and\
someone with Devil Speed or Evil Wave can reach the Legion on the left. If they\
have Animal Leg, they can get closer to the Orobas at the top (it'll move if\
you're in range). Whoever went after the northernmost Orobas should be able to\
get rid of one of the Badb Catha teams before the MC goes again.\
\
Honestly, I'm not sure why there's so much hype about trying to win in one turn\
only. Naoya's response is basically the same as if you'd done it in two turns -\
he calls it "passing" - and his requirement was three turns. Two is enough and\
easily doable on your first playthrough, as it'll still unlock his route. If\
you're having a really hard time, just target the team leaders. Also make sure\
to kill anything with Bind, or else this'll be a bit annoying.\
\
Otherwise, Naoya just sort of stands there on the side. Don't worry about him -\
he won't do anything, and you can't attack him.\
\
You'll receive up to 1520 EXP and 1020 Macca at the end.\

Hey look, old friends. After you attack the SDF Captain, he'll make two of\
those red demon-generating squares appear. They'll probably kick in right when\
the battle's winding down, so it's no big deal. Send Atsuro to deal with the\
Abaddons and you're all set.\
\
Otherwise, this is pretty straightforward. The Evil Wave users might be\
annoying, along with the Captain's Revive auto skill, which will Recarm any of\
his fallen companions. Keep out of their range on the first turn so you can\
swarm them on your second.\
\
If you're having trouble with the soldiers escaping, you might want to make\
sure you have a few teams covering both exits. If you're -really- having a hard\
time, you might want to resort to something like Petra Eyes, to immobilize them\
and take them out quickly. Or, target the team leaders themselves. Worst comes\
to worst, have your teams stand on the escape panels to block them off. But\
again, shouldn't be too difficult.\
\
I've gotten several emails on this battle specifically, but...there's not much\
else I can say except what I've said above. Remember strengths and weaknesses,\
and if you use too many vit-oriented demons, they're going to die (most of the\
SDF's demons are mag-oriented, and since magic defense depends on your magic\
stat...). So if your demons are at a good level but are still falling over like\
logs, that'd be why. Unless you're not paying attention to weaknesses, in which\
case, it's that, too.\

You'll earn about 1600 EXP and 1090 Macca at the end.\

Odd battle. Either way, be sure to choose to help out the demons, as 1) the\
tamers give better experience (by far) and a few skill cracks, and 2) you won't\
be able to get Black Frost otherwise.\
\
If you chose to go after the demons for whatever reason, you're really not\
going to have a hard time. Otherwise, having someone who can Switch with one of\
the low-level demons at the start of the battle will help you get to the tamers\
sooner and keep the demons safe (one hit, and it's over for them). Just be\
mindful of the tamers' Ban auto abilities, and you should be fine. The really\
annoying one's the Ban Phys user who has two Abaddon. Either have a few Pierce\
users attack, or have one speedy demon/char use a phys attack, to allow multi-\
target phys attacks through from other members on that team.\

Especially if you're skill cracking, this battle's one huge race - either to\
save Gin, or to kill Azuma and the other Believers before Gin does. Gin's\
strength is a bit random, to me - once he wiped out Azuma's team in one hit,\
and once his team got slaughtered while he only inflicted 30 damage. So it sort\
of depends on your luck.\
\
Either way, you'll want the skill cracks. Gin, while he has the Revive auto\
skill, doesn't have healing, so get moving. Devil Speed and Phantasma are your\
best friends here (though Mothman will be kind of obsolete by this time, you\
don't really have a choice unless you're on New Game+ and can fuse a level 62\
Behemoth). Switch out Gin if you need to, as well. The enemy has a ton of Ban\
auto skills, but nothing you can't handle. If you need Gin's help to get you\
through this battle, by all means, keep him healed and let him fight. With\
Revive, he can last a really long time.\
\
When the battle's finished, Take-Mikazuchi will be unlocked as a fusion in the\

Desperate demon tamers picking fights, joy. Why are you always the mediator,\
again? Anyway, the office worker types are pretty much weaker than the thugs,\
and if you don't get to them first the thugs will probably wipe them out.\
\
You're probably better off sending one person down the skinny east path to deal\
with the two tamers that'll be there, and the rest straight south to deal with\
the mob. Don't let yourself get ganged up on and you'll be okay - especially\
since they'll all be softening each other up, probably before you get there.\

First of all, it doesn't matter what you choose - this battle doesn't affect\
your getting Amane's or Naoya's routes. So for the most experience and the\
easiest time, you might as well choose to eliminate both the angels and demons.\
If you can't handle it and it's too hard, then choosing to eliminate only the\
demons will be a lot easier.\
\
Something like Phantasma could be pretty helpful for maneuvering, due to those\
annoying half-barricades in the middle. And Power does have Recarm, so be wary\
of that.\
\
Every time you kill a demon or angel team, another reinforcement team will\
appear. Eventually, Honda and the civilian will attempt to escape. You can\
defeat them without killing them, and they'll leave the field. If they escape,\
you lose. If you choose to escape with them, you obviously lose as well. This\
is pretty much a battle of endurance considering all the enemies you'll be\
fighting. It's a good test for the strength of your team, too - with the Final\
Day coming up, if you can't handle these demons, it's a good sign that you need\
to fuse up your own demons, level up your team, or consider strategy more.\

You'll receive up to 1880 EXP and 1260 Macca at the end.\

Now this is a fun battle. Yeah, where to begin. First are all the demons, I\
suppose. Half of the teams have Chaos Wave and Evil Wave, and most of those are\
on the left side. Belial will pretty much come at you from the right side (he\
makes a beeline for the MC), so you'll want to split up your party. I suggest\
you have Yuzu and the MC go towards the right prepped for the fight against\
Belial (more below). Your other teams should deal with all other demons and be\
ready to help fight Belial or heal when needed.\
\
I'd advise giving Yuzu (or Midori, etc) an Evil Wave user (Python or Celebre).\
Belial can attack 3x per turn, but he can't do anything (and his Life Aid\
doesn't kick in) if you use Evil Wave. So have Yuzu behind the MC, weakening\
Belial and healing the MC, while you Bufudyne him to pieces. (You might want to\
give Yuzu abilities like Drain or passives to keep her MP up.) Be sure to equip\
things like fire/phys resistances, Ice Rise/Jump, etc etc. Having a tyrant like\
Hecate around will also help slow down Belial's turns and replenish some much-\
needed MP. Also, whichever demons you're using on the MC's team? Should null/\
drain/reflect fire. The last thing you need is three hits of Maragidyne every\
time you engage.\
\
Actually, Belial has Pierce, so if you have a Fire reflect, put that demon in\
the left slot of your party - I believe that'll stop Pierce from working on the\
other two party members, if they have null/drain fire. (It's what happens to me\
when I'm against Piercing demons, anyway.)\
\
Fire of Sodom is a multitarget attack that does heavy fire damage to everyone.\
Hopefully you didn't bring anyone weak to fire... At least it doesn't heal\
Belial, or you'd be in trouble.\
\
After a while, when you get Belial's HP down fairly low, reinforcements will\
show up at the south end in two groups. Hopefully you're fighting Belial as far\
north as you can. At this point your other party members can try to hold them\
off if possible; or you should focus everyone's energy on defeating Belial, as\
your party's probably fairly weakened by now.\
\
You'll earn about 2100 EXP and 1360 Macca at the end.\

Just one of those random optional battles that you shouldn't bother fighting,\
but. Basically there are a ton of hypnotized civilians who'll keep moving\
towards the Sage of Time. Luckily, the other demons won't attack them, but they\
will attack you. Rush to the civilians and choose Wake to get them out of their\
trances; they'll start escaping. Devil Speed your way towards the Sage of Time\
and take him out with strong physical, almighty, or Pierce.\
\
Every few turns or so, another new civilian will show up. Kind of a pain, but\
just keep waking them all and hammering away at the Sage of Time and his demon\

\
First, you can walk on the molten lava, but you will take fire damage from\
"Fanatic's Lava" at the end of your turn (ow). But, unless you have Evil Wave\
or Chaos Wave, you'll have to stand on it to attack Jezebel. So you might want\
all the str/null/reflect fire you can have on the teams that'll go after her.\
That or use Animal Leg to move back onto not-lava-covered ground.\
\
The Decarabias won't move towards you unless you're in their range. So. Unless\
you have a team that nulls fire and can afford to spend a turn or so traversing\
the lava, have your teams go around it and take care of the Decarabias. And\
note Jezebel's 3x range, and move accordingly. She tends to use Maragidyne,\
which is another good reason to have Null/Reflect fire. She'll also whip out\
Judgement a few times, so you'll need to keep healing and/or be strong against\
Mystic while you're at it.\
\
Damage Jezebel enough and the place will revert back to a flowery garden\
(meaning no lava to worry about). You'll also snap Amane out of her stupor.\
Jezebel will summon up three doppelgangers of Amane (Mind Amanes). If Amane\
gets possessed again, it's the end, so you'll have to defeat them and protect\
her. Note that even if you defeat the Mind Amanes, they'll just keep spawning\
so that there'll always be at least two on the map. So, you'll have to focus\
your energy on Jezebel. And if the Mind Amane teams are slaughtering you (with\
Cerberus's Deathbound and Ukano Mitama's Ma-dyne skills, this might be), really\
focus all your energy on Jezebel and hold out as best as you can.\
\
Interestingly enough, the Mind Amane teams give far more EXP than Jezebel does.\
Ah well. In fact, if you're on NG+ and you're looking for a place to grind\
besides/before the Lucifer battle, this isn't bad for it - a Mind Amane team\
will give you about 8000+ EXP a pop, and they easily and quickly respawn.\
Better than a free battle, at least.\
\
You'll receive about 2300 EXP and 1500 Macca at the end.\
\
   NOTE: After this battle, Amane will join your party. Her Magic is better\
         than Yuzu's, but her Speed's sorely lacking (she can't use Ma-dyne\
         skills). If you want more of a magic tank than a magic blitzer, I\
         suppose you could switch her into your party.\

\
A Kishin-type boss. (Four Devas is basically Kishin's Double Up + Genma's\
Phantasm sans the lowered movement cost.) At level 65. Could be painful, so get\
ready.\
\
One reinforcement team appears every few turns or so. Cerberus has high Agility\
and Yaksa has a devastating Deathbound, so you might want to get rid of them\
with a strong ice user if you can. Ice and Almighty will also work wonders\
against Bishamon.\
\
The Rangda teams are going to be pure misery for Atsuro and/or your physical-\
attack demons. So be careful with your multi-target physical attacks. It might\
be better to send a team of them towards Bishamon instead, especially if they\
have high Vitality, which you're going to want against him. Pierce would help\
against his resistance to phys, too (unless they can wield Ice attacks).\
\
Lucky for you, if Bishamon attacks twice, he'll be pushed pretty far down in\
the turn order and you won't have to worry about him initiating attacks for a\
while. Send some strong Ice users (Culebre would work really well here, with\
Ma/bufudyne and Evil Wave, preventing you from getting hit), and pace yourself.\
The moment one of your teams gets severely damaged, get it away from Bishamon\
and healed up quickly. With Attack All + Dual Shadow, a fluke could send you\
flying.\
\
But yes. Definitely have a few users with Sama/recarm if possible, and major\
healing abilities. You can try putting Ban Phys on the team with your weakest\
(vitality-wise) demons for a little help.\
\
You'll earn about 2500 EXP and 1800 Macca at the end.\

\
\
As if the not-so-subtle "I have a feeling we should be careful" and "are you\
ready?" messages weren't enough warning, you get to fight two Devas here.\
\
There are a crapload of enemies, but most of them have elemental weaknesses\
that you can easily take advantage of. In particular, someone with strong elec-\
type attacks should go towards Koumoku, and someone with force towards Zouchou.\
Have all the Ma-dynes equipped to make it easier on yourself, as all the teams\
have two of the same demon (and thus twice the susceptibility), with the\
exception of the Devas' teams. You might want to send your physical attackers\
towards the Yaksa and not the Rangda. Actually, forget the "might" part.\
\
Otherwise, both Devas are noticeably weaker than Bishamon, and don't have as\
many resistances or annoying passives. Still, both of them have Evil Wave, so\
couple that with Double Up and you might get hit pretty hard if you're not\
prepared. Be patient and don't let the enemies get the jump on you, and kill\
the Culebres when you get a chance. Just move cautiously and keep yourself\
healed, and this should go pretty smoothly.\
\
You'll earn about 2700 EXP and 2100 Macca at the end.\

\
So. Charming bug thing aside. Doesn't look like a particularly tough battle\
with anything strange to throw at you, and you get a nice choice of skills to\
crack, right?\
\
Yeah, well. Have a magic user with a lot of MP crack Prayer during this battle\
and set it (if you don't have it already). Have a Megami or two. And give\
someone like Atsuro Amrita. You'll see why later. Also, a few Sama/recarms\
won't hurt, and are probably necessary.\
\
Belzaboul has an immense attack range, but it takes a while for his turn to\
come up. Take advantage of that time as follows.\
\
Once you kill two teams OR attack Belzaboul, the battle changes. Make sure that\
whatever you chose to crack (that isn't on Belzaboul), you crack within those\
two teams you kill. The reason why is afterwards, all the remaining teams\
change into Maggots. Yes, very charming. They're far more dangerous than run-\
of-the-mill demons, as they have the Spawn almighty attack. This'll deal damage\
and have a fairly good chance of spawning eggs on the target, which is a status\
ailment indicated by a little bug.\
\
This is why you need all those teams with the ability to not just heal, but\
cure. A few very short turns after, the eggs'll hatch and deal damage, usually\
killing their host, and it'll spawn a new team of maggots on the map. So fun.\
Belzaboul also has Spawn now, so you can't really avoid it. Just cure whoever\
gets afflicted as quickly as possible, and revive who you need to, as you're\
probably not going to be able to avoid several party members dying.\
\
So, Belzaboul. Again, don't attack it until after the Maggots appear to\
maximize your skill cracks. Spam almighty on it, use demons strong against\
mystic, etc. If you have anyone that reflects force, that'd help minorly. If\
the team you use to attack him has Amrita/Prayer/Affection, that'll help, as\
you have a fairly good chance of getting afflicted. Just cure your way through\
this battle and hold your ground (and towards the end, you should be able to\
keep your party members all right next to Belzaboul so he can't strike you\
without retaliation). Easily a very, very annoying battle if you let the\
Maggots get out of hand, so you'll want that cure.\
\
You'll get about 2950 EXP and 2400 Macca at the end.\

\
\
I'd advise you to crack Victory Cry off Belberith and three of the four\
available auto skills off the Believers (especially Rage Soul and Grace).\
Unless you still don't have Samarecarm and Mediarahan, in which case.\
\
Phantasm or Flight would be pretty helpful for this battle, as you could then\
pass through the obstacles/looping area where you deploy. Then, with the\
bridges sealed off, you'll have to send two teams to the control area (the\
consoles must be activated simultaneously), and two teams to either end to wait\
for the bridges to go up. If you have Phantasm/Flight, put it on the teams\
heading towards the consoles, as they'll be able to leap up onto the altar and\
fight Belberith without having to double all the way back around. Devil Speed's\
the next best choice.\
\
You also want to put Ma/zandyne and Almighty abilities on your main Belberith\
attackers. Physical fighters with Pierce are also good.\
\
Get within three spaces of the Believers and they will move to attack you.\
Otherwise, they won't move. The two Believers on the sides will make their\
COMPs go berserk upon defeat, creating those red demon-generating spaces where\
they were standing. When you defeat the two Believers standing on the switch\
activation spots, a reinforcement each will appear on the red spaces by\
Belberith. You'll probably want to pick up those COMPs to stop the\
reinforcements, especially if you're struggling here.\
\
Against the Believer with Rage Soul, you'll want a team that has Devil Speed\
(for the +15 initiative), insane agility, or a ton of phys resist fighters,\
otherwise that team's going to hit you real hard. And don't forget the teams\
that have Barrier and Wall and accidentally use really powerful phys or magic\
that'll just reflect on you. You might want to send your physical fighter\
toward the Barrier user and vice versa; note that Barrier does not block\
Almighty, at least.\
\
Belberith is way down below in the turn order, as you'll probably get to move\
two or three times before his first attack. Unfortunately, he can target anyone\
he likes, so you can't really do anything about that. In my case he always went\
after Yuzu, which I suspect is because of her Magic Yang ability. (Yeah, who\
knows.) If one of your teams is pretty weakened, though, he'll definitely\
target them, so be warned.\
\
Belberith's weak to force and has Maziodyne and Mabufudyne. So, no demons that\
are weak to elec or ice. If you have any that can reflect, that's even better.\
Victory Cry will heal a good chunk of HP and MP, so you want to be dealing a\
good 500 damage or so every time you engage him at the least. Though, if you\
have a souped-up magic-oriented MC and/or Yuzu, either of them with Holy Dance\
should easily hit for 500-ish damage on their own. A Megami with Holy Dance\
will do just as much damage, if not more (and you really should have Norn or\
Amaterasu by now, anyway).\
\
By the way, if you need to fuse Holy Dance onto anyone, just buy a few Ym with\
Watchful. Let them get experience (especially if they haven't learned Holy\
Dance yet), fuse them into a Mitama that'll get some experience, and fuse it to\
whatever demon. You'll get Holy Dance, +3 Strength, and maybe a boost to other\
stats as well. Not a bad deal when you make this much Macca at this point.\
\
You'll earn about 3200 EXP and 2800 Macca at the end.\
\
\
   NOTE: The free battle at the top of the Hills building can net you an\
         awesome skill crack. Shiva, a Deity, appears very, very rarely - I'd\
         say about 5% of the time or so - but he has Megidolaon and Victory\
         Cry. This is definitely where you want to get Megidolaon from, so.\
         Keep fighting/retreating from/restarting the free battle until you\
         see it.\

\
\
You're still going to want Flight and Phantasm, this time to get back over the\
altar to the other side, where Naoya is. And you'll want to crack Anti-All, as\
this is pretty much your only chance to get it.\
\
A turn in, flashy gigolo guy will appear on the right side, reveal himself as\
Loki, and fight you. His Megidolaon will definitely hurt, so approach him\
carefully. Draining away his MP could help, as it's very doable with a magic-\
oriented MC. Still, Tyranny + Mana Aid will thwart you a bit. Atsuro + Pierce\
and a host of phys boosters/skills should help. And you can also just Evil/\
Chaos Wave him if need be.\
\
Naoya...also has Megidolaon. But he doesn't have any mana-replenishing moves,\
so Drain might be a better idea on him. Pretty much only Almighty attacks are\
going to do good damage to him (plus they'll bypass his Shield All), so.\
\
In short, against Loki and Naoya, you're just going to want a lot of Almighty\
and a lot of endurance. And hope they don't use Me/diarahan too much. If their\
magic abilities are really causing you that much trouble, you might have to\
resort to a Pierce + Makajamaon/Mute Eyes combination.\
\
After this battle, you'll be able to fuse Loki, a Tyrant-type, in the Cathedral\
of Shadows.\
\
You'll get about 3300 EXP and 2900 Macca at the end.\

So, final battle. Be prepared, obviously. No wimpy demons (yours should all be\
pretty high-tier, maybe with average base levels in the mid-50s - if you're on\
New Game+, though, you should easily have some base level 60s), because you do\
not have the MP to be wasting on Samarecarm every other turn in this battle. \
Have a few Tyrant- (if you've unlocked Loki, here's a great battle for him) and\
Divine-type demons (Kazfiel, Remiel) to keep your MP up. You'll be using things\
like Holy Dance a ton in this battle, and you don't want to run out. Having a\
Deity (Shiva, Asura) with Awakening to up the strength of your Almighty attacks\
can help, too. And obviously you want healing and cure.\
\
Oh, and put Ma/ziodyne on your main magic-using attackers. Along with the usual\
Almighty, etc. Babel's final form is weak to elec. You might also want to put\
Ma/zandyne on a few people, as well.\
\
About every three turns or so two reinforcements will appear in the northwest\
and northeast red circles. Unfortunately, they're not those demon-spawning\
squares caused by COMPs that you can pick up, so get used to them.\
\
The first Babel form shouldn't be too hard. Rush it, spam almighty and/or\
characters with pierce, and it should go down quickly.\
\
Once that's done, Babel shows its true form. Well, not quite - it summons Beldr\
and Belial, first of all. Oh yeah. And yep, only the MC can damage Belial. All\
of your teams will be clustered around the organ in the center.\
\
Don't worry about having a Kishin on the MC \'96 Beldr has low HP, and if you're\
at a good level, he won't be a problem at all. And Belial's still weak to ice.\
Defeat them, and a ramp will appear leading to Babel \'96 with Jezebel guarding\
it. This'll lead to a series of fights \'96 first her, then Beelzebub, then\
Belberith. Don't worry about Beelzebub's spawn \'96 once you defeat it, the\
ailment will disappear from anyone who had it. If you defeat it fast enough,\
that is.\
\
All the Bels have the same resistances and weaknesses that they did the first\
time you fought them. So implement the same strategies you used before, etc.\
\
After all that, Babel will split open and you'll be able to fight it. It's now\
got an infinite attack range and a new repertoire that includes Megidolaon. \
Basically you'll want to be kind of careful at this point. If you have a slow\
healer in your lineup, you can have them heal on the assumption that Babel'll\
deal pretty bad damage with Megidolaon or Attack All, especially if Babel has\
an Extra Turn.\
\
Babel does have a weakness to elec, and Atsuro + pierce will blow through his\
Str to phys. Of course, you should still be spamming almighty as well.\
Otherwise, this is a huge battle of endurance. Suspend here and there, because\
dealing with a Dual Shadow'd Megidolaon is not particularly fun.\
\
\
And...the end. You're now the overlord - er, Messiah. And stuff. But, you now\
get to fuse Metatron, a Divine-type, in the Cathedral of Shadows.\

There are four of the red demon-generating spaces, and they'll all cough up\
reinforcements every three turns or so. You can pick up the COMPs by standing\
on those spaces, but you probably won't need to. I basically had one person\
kill nearly all the reinforcements while I had the other three teams chase\
Naoya around.\
\
Ah yes. On Naoya's first turn (and he has a whopping speed of 75, so there's\
nothing to be done), he'll run away from you with Devil Speed and Phantasma.\
Consider this a warning of how the rest of the battle will go.\
\
The main problem lies in catching up to him. You can have a few of your guys\
chase him and someone with Switch ready to move in just in time to attack\
before he runs again, which worked the best for me. Phantasm will help lower\
your move costs and make it easier to get around. You might be able to catch up\
with Devil Speed, as well. Without at least one of those, you might be a little\
sunk.\
\
To defeat Naoya, you'll want to use teams with phys null/reflect/drain. Full\
Might (ensures critical) plus two Deathbound users equals pain, pain, pain.\
Almighty damage is your best way to damage him, though his Behemoth's weak to\
fire. Getting rid of it will keep Naoya from running away, as well. When you\
weaken Naoya enough he won't run any more, either.\
\
You'll receive about 2300 EXP and 1500 Macca at the end.\

A Kishin-type boss. (Four Devas is basically Kishin's Double Up + Genma's\
Phantasm sans the lowered movement cost.) At level 65. Could be painful, so get\
ready.\
\
One reinforcement team appears every few turns or so. Cerberus has high Agility\
and Yaksa has a devastating Deathbound, so you might want to get rid of them\
with a strong ice user if you can. Ice and Almighty will also work wonders\
against Bishamon.\
\
The Rangda teams are going to be pure misery for your physical fighter (Atsuro,\
Izuna, or both) and/or physical-attack demons. So be careful with your multi-\
target physical attacks. It might be better to send a team of them towards\
Bishamon instead, especially if they have high Vitality, which you're going to\
want against him. Pierce would help against his resistance to phys, too (unless\
they can wield Ice attacks).\
\
Lucky for you, if Bishamon attacks twice, he'll be pushed pretty far down in\
the turn order and you won't have to worry about him initiating attacks for a\
while. Send some strong Ice users (Culebre would work really well here, with\
Ma/bufudyne and Evil Wave, preventing you from getting hit), and pace yourself.\
The moment one of your teams gets severely damaged, get it away from Bishamon\
and healed up quickly. With Attack All + Dual Shadow, a fluke could send you\
flying.\
\
But yes. Definitely have a few users with Sama/recarm if possible, and major\
healing abilities. You can try putting Ban Phys on the team with your weakest\
(vitality-wise) demons for a little help.\
\
(By the way, if you've decided to use Izuna...well, you should definitely be\
using Atsuro no matter what - he's required in the final battle. Just saying.)\
\
You'll earn about 2500 EXP and 1800 Macca at the end.\

\
\
As if the not-so-subtle "I have a feeling we should be careful" and "are you\
ready?" messages weren't enough warning, you get to fight two Devas here.\
\
There are a crapload of enemies, but most of them have elemental weaknesses\
that you can easily take advantage of. In particular, someone with strong elec-\
type attacks should go towards Koumoku, and someone with force towards Zouchou.\
Have all the Ma-dynes equipped to make it easier on yourself, as all the teams\
have two of the same demon (and thus twice the susceptibility), with the\
exception of the Devas' teams. You might want to send your physical attacker/s\
towards the Yaksa and not the Rangda. Actually, forget the "might" part.\
\
Otherwise, both Devas are noticeably weaker than Bishamon, and don't have as\
many resistances or annoying passives. Still, both of them have Evil Wave, so\
couple that with Double Up and you might get hit pretty hard if you're not\
prepared. Be patient and don't let the enemies get the jump on you, and kill\
the Culebres when you get a chance. Just move cautiously and keep yourself\
healed, and this should go pretty smoothly.\
\
You'll earn about 2700 EXP and 2100 Macca at the end.\

\
So. Charming bug thing aside. Doesn't look like a particularly tough battle\
with anything strange to throw at you, and you get a nice choice of skills to\
crack, right?\
\
Yeah, well. Have a magic user with a lot of MP crack Prayer during this battle\
and set it (if you don't have it already). Have a Megami or two. And give\
someone like Atsuro/Izuna Amrita. You'll see why later. Also, a few\
Sama/recarms won't hurt, and are probably necessary.\
\
Belzaboul has an immense attack range, but it takes a while for his turn to\
come up. Take advantage of that time as follows.\
\
Once you kill two teams OR attack Belzaboul, the battle changes. Make sure that\
whatever you chose to crack (that isn't on Belzaboul), you crack within those\
two teams you kill. The reason why is afterwards, all the remaining teams\
change into Maggots. Yes, very charming. They're far more dangerous than run-\
of-the-mill demons, as they have the Spawn almighty attack. This'll deal damage\
and have a fairly good chance of spawning eggs on the target, which is a status\
ailment indicated by a little bug.\
\
This is why you need all those teams with the ability to not just heal, but\
cure. A few very short turns after, the eggs'll hatch and deal damage, usually\
killing their host, and it'll spawn a new team of maggots on the map. So fun.\
Belzaboul also has Spawn now, so you can't really avoid it. Just cure whoever\
gets afflicted as quickly as possible, and revive who you need to, as you're\
probably not going to be able to avoid several party members dying.\
\
So, Belzaboul. Again, don't attack it until after the Maggots appear to\
maximize your skill cracks. Spam almighty on it, use demons strong against\
mystic, etc. If you have anyone that reflects force, that'd help minorly. If\
the team you use to attack him has Amrita/Prayer/Affection, that'll help, as\
you have a fairly good chance of getting afflicted. Just cure your way through\
this battle and hold your ground (and towards the end, you should be able to\
keep your party members all right next to Belzaboul so he can't strike you\
without retaliation). Easily a very, very annoying battle if you let the\
Maggots get out of hand, so you'll want that cure.\
\
You'll get about 2950 EXP and 2400 Macca at the end.\

\
\
I'd advise you to crack Victory Cry off Belberith and three of the four\
available auto skills off the Believers (especially Rage Soul and Grace).\
Unless you still don't have Samarecarm and Mediarahan, in which case.\
\
Phantasm or Flight would be pretty helpful for this battle, as you could then\
pass through the obstacles/looping area where you deploy. Then, with the\
bridges sealed off, you'll have to send two teams to the control area (the\
consoles must be activated simultaneously), and two teams to either end to wait\
for the bridges to go up. If you have Phantasm/Flight, put it on the teams\
heading towards the consoles, as they'll be able to leap up onto the altar and\
fight Belberith without having to double all the way back around. Devil Speed's\
the next best choice.\
\
You also want to put Ma/zandyne and Almighty abilities on your main Belberith\
attackers. Physical fighters with Pierce are also good.\
\
Get within three spaces of the Believers and they will move to attack you.\
Otherwise, they won't move. The two Believers on the sides will make their\
COMPs go berserk upon defeat, creating those red demon-generating spaces where\
they were standing. When you defeat the two Believers standing on the switch\
activation spots, a reinforcement each will appear on the red spaces by\
Belberith. You'll probably want to pick up those COMPs to stop the\
reinforcements, especially if you're struggling here.\
\
Against the Believer with Rage Soul, you'll want a team that has Devil Speed\
(for the +15 initiative), insane agility, or a ton of phys resist fighters,\
otherwise that team's going to hit you real hard. And don't forget the teams\
that have Barrier and Wall and accidentally use really powerful phys or magic\
that'll just reflect on you. You might want to send your physical fighter\
toward the Barrier user and vice versa; note that Barrier does not block\
Almighty, at least.\
\
Belberith is way down below in the turn order, as you'll probably get to move\
two or three times before his first attack. Unfortunately, he can target anyone\
he likes, so you can't really do anything about that. In my case he always went\
after Yuzu, which I suspect is because of her Magic Yang ability. (Yeah, who\
knows.) If one of your teams is pretty weakened, though, he'll definitely\
target them, so be warned.\
\
Belberith's weak to force and has Maziodyne and Mabufudyne. So, no demons that\
are weak to elec or ice. If you have any that can reflect, that's even better.\
Victory Cry will heal a good chunk of HP and MP, so you want to be dealing a\
good 500 damage or so every time you engage him at the least. Though, if you\
have a souped-up magic-oriented MC and/or Yuzu, either of them with Holy Dance\
should easily hit for 500-ish damage on their own. A Megami with Holy Dance\
will do just as much damage, if not more (and you really should have Norn or\
Amaterasu by now, anyway).\
\
By the way, if you need to fuse Holy Dance onto anyone, just buy a few Ym with\
Watchful. Let them get experience (especially if they haven't learned Holy\
Dance yet), fuse them into a Mitama that'll get some experience, and fuse it to\
whatever demon. You'll get Holy Dance, +3 Strength, and maybe a boost to other\
stats as well. Not a bad deal when you make this much Macca at this point.\
\
You'll earn about 3200 EXP and 2800 Macca at the end.\
\
\
   NOTE: The free battle at the top of the Hills building can net you an\
         awesome skill crack. Shiva, a Deity, appears very, very rarely - I'd\
         say about 5% of the time or so - but he has Megidolaon and Victory\
         Cry. This is definitely where you want to get Megidolaon from, so.\
         Keep fighting/retreating from/restarting the free battle until you\
         see it.\

\
So, final battle. Be prepared, obviously. No wimpy demons (yours should all be\
pretty high-tier, maybe with average base levels in the mid-50s - if you're on\
New Game+, though, you should easily have some base level 60s), because you do\
not have the MP to be wasting on Samarecarm every other turn in this battle. \
Have a few Tyrant- (if you've unlocked Loki, here's a great battle for him) and\
Divine-type demons (Kazfiel, Remiel) to keep your MP up. You'll be using things\
like Holy Dance a ton in this battle, and you don't want to run out. Having a\
Deity (Shiva, Asura) with Awakening to up the strength of your Almighty attacks\
can help, too.\
\
About every three turns or so two reinforcements will appear in the northwest\
and northeast red circles. Unfortunately, they're not those demon-spawning\
squares caused by COMPs that you can pick up, so get used to them.\
\
Your first goal's to let Naoya get to the center stage so he can hack the\
server. He's not weak by any means, so protecting him shouldn't be hard. When\
Naoya gets there, he'll point Atsuro to the right platform. Might want to\
prepare your party beforehand by making sure everyone's fairly healed before\
letting Atsuro access the console. Once Atsuro gets there, a big...gray\
floating head will appear at the tower. The security program, apparently, aka\
Babel.\
\
But as Naoya says, your hack's dead in the water if you don't take care of it.\
And if Babel attacks three times before you take it down, it'll shut down\
Atsuro's console and you'll have to move him all the way to the other one. So,\
try not to let that happen if you can, as the reinforcements don't stop coming\
and Atsuro's more or less out of commission when he's at the console. The first\
form shouldn't be too hard. Spam almighty and/or characters with pierce, and it\
should go down quickly.\
\
Once that's done, Babel shows its true form. Very appealing \'96 especially the\
infinite attack range (luckily it doesn't go after Naoya) and a new move\
repertoire that includes Megidolaon. You'll get Atsuro again for this part of\
the battle, so it should help a little. Basically you'll want to be kind of\
careful at this point. If you have a slow healer in your lineup, you can have\
them heal on the assumption that Babel'll deal pretty bad damage with\
Megidolaon or Attack All, especially if Babel has an Extra Turn.\
\
Note that Babel does have a weakness, but it might be hard to take advantage of\
it. Every time you hack away 1/3 of Babel's HP, it'll change forms \'96 which\
means a different weakness (elec, force, phys) and Ma-dyne spells. So hit its\
weakness if you can (in particular, Atsuro can probably get there in time for\
the third form to take advantage of that phys weakness), though you should\
still be spamming almighty as well. Otherwise, this is a huge battle of\
endurance. Suspend here and there, because dealing with a Dual Shadow'd\
Megidolaon is not particularly fun.\
\
This fight against Babel definitely isn't as bad as other Babel fights in other\
routes, though, so be thankful. :]\
\
\
At the end of the battle, you can choose between three options to return all\
the demons. As far as I can tell, there's really no difference among them.\
And...yep, that's all for Atsuro's route. You don't unlock any fusions in this\
one. Not a bad route at all, though.\

\
After you make your choice, you'll gain Gin as a party member. If you fulfilled\
the requirements, you'll also get Mari and Black Frost. This is the only route\
where you can play as Gin, so if you're like me and you tend to play as\
characters whom you like, not just the strongest/etc ones, take advantage of\
it. Otherwise, a crazy number of characters join you on this route (Amane,\
Izuna...basically everyone except Naoya and Kaido), so you'll have a lot of\
options.\
\
However, doesn't mean you should use everyone. If you're not on your first\
playthrough you can do what you will, but I highly advise that you use Atsuro\
and don't use Black Frost, because of things that will happen in the final\
Babel fight. And if you're on your first playthrough...it'll be really hard\
otherwise.\
\
Remember, even if your team leaders are at comparable levels to the enemies\
you're fighting, you have to remember your demons as well. Really, really.\
Always keep them up-to-date. If you're really struggling, that's probably why.\

\
First, you can walk on the molten lava, but you will take fire damage from\
"Fanatic's Lava" at the end of your turn (ow). But, unless you have Evil Wave\
or Chaos Wave, you'll have to stand on it to attack Jezebel. So you might want\
all the str/null/reflect fire you can have on the teams that'll go after her.\
That or use Animal Leg to move back onto not-lava-covered ground.\
\
The Decarabias won't move towards you unless you're in their range. So. Unless\
you have a team that nulls fire and can afford to spend a turn or so traversing\
the lava, have your teams go around it and take care of the Decarabias. And\
note Jezebel's 3x range, and move accordingly. She tends to use Maragidyne,\
which is another good reason to have Null/Reflect fire. She'll also whip out\
Judgement a few times, so you'll need to keep healing and/or be strong against\
Mystic while you're at it.\
\
Damage Jezebel enough and the place will revert back to a flowery garden\
(meaning no lava to worry about). You'll also snap Amane out of her stupor.\
Jezebel will summon up three doppelgangers of Amane (Mind Amanes). If Amane\
gets possessed again, it's the end, so you'll have to defeat them and protect\
her. Note that even if you defeat the Mind Amanes, they'll just keep spawning\
so that there'll always be at least two on the map. So, you'll have to focus\
your energy on Jezebel. And if the Mind Amane teams are slaughtering you (with\
Cerberus's Deathbound and Ukano Mitama's Ma-dyne skills, this might be), really\
focus all your energy on Jezebel and hold out as best as you can.\
\
Interestingly enough, the Mind Amane teams give far more EXP than Jezebel does.\
Ah well. In fact, if you're on NG+ and you're looking for a place to grind\
besides/before the Lucifer battle, this isn't bad for it - a Mind Amane team\
will give you about 8000+ EXP a pop, and they easily and quickly respawn.\
Better than a free battle, at least.\
\
You'll receive about 2300 EXP and 1500 Macca at the end.\
\
   NOTE: After this battle, Amane will join your party. Her Magic is better\
         than Yuzu's, but her Speed's sorely lacking (she can't use Ma-dyne\
         skills). If you want more of a magic tank than a magic blitzer, I\
         suppose you could switch her into your party.\

\
\
A Kishin-type boss. (Four Devas is basically Kishin's Double Up + Genma's\
Phantasm sans the lowered movement cost.) At level 65. Could be painful, so get\
ready.\
\
One reinforcement team appears every few turns or so. Cerberus has high Agility\
and Yaksa has a devastating Deathbound, so you might want to get rid of them\
with a strong ice user if you can. Ice and Almighty will also work wonders\
against Bishamon.\
\
The Rangda teams are going to be pure misery for Atsuro and/or your physical-\
attack demons. So be careful with your multi-target physical attacks. It might\
be better to send a team of them towards Bishamon instead, especially if they\
have high Vitality, which you're going to want against him. Pierce would help\
against his resistance to phys, too (unless they can wield Ice attacks).\
\
Lucky for you, if Bishamon attacks twice, he'll be pushed pretty far down in\
the turn order and you won't have to worry about him initiating attacks for a\
while. Send some strong Ice users (Culebre would work really well here, with\
Ma/bufudyne and Evil Wave, preventing you from getting hit), and pace yourself.\
The moment one of your teams gets severely damaged, get it away from Bishamon\
and healed up quickly. With Attack All + Dual Shadow, a fluke could send you\
flying.\
\
But yes. Definitely have a few users with Sama/recarm if possible, and major\
healing abilities. You can try putting Ban Phys on the team with your weakest\
(vitality-wise) demons for a little help.\
\
You'll earn about 2500 EXP and 1800 Macca at the end.\

\
\
As if the not-so-subtle "I have a feeling we should be careful" and "are you\
ready?" messages weren't enough warning, you get to fight two Devas here.\
\
There are a crapload of enemies, but most of them have elemental weaknesses\
that you can easily take advantage of. In particular, someone with strong elec-\
type attacks should go towards Koumoku, and someone with force towards Zouchou.\
Have all the Ma-dynes equipped to make it easier on yourself, as all the teams\
have two of the same demon (and thus twice the susceptibility), with the\
exception of the Devas' teams. You might want to send your physical attackers\
towards the Yaksa and not the Rangda. Actually, forget the "might" part.\
\
Otherwise, both Devas are noticeably weaker than Bishamon, and don't have as\
many resistances or annoying passives. Still, both of them have Evil Wave, so\
couple that with Double Up and you might get hit pretty hard if you're not\
prepared. Be patient and don't let the enemies get the jump on you, and kill\
the Culebres when you get a chance. Just move cautiously and keep yourself\
healed, and this should go pretty smoothly.\
\
You'll earn about 2700 EXP and 2100 Macca at the end.\

\
So. Charming bug thing aside. Doesn't look like a particularly tough battle\
with anything strange to throw at you, and you get a nice choice of skills to\
crack, right?\
\
Yeah, well. Have a magic user with a lot of MP crack Prayer during this battle\
and set it (if you don't have it already). Have a Megami or two. And give\
someone like Atsuro Amrita. You'll see why later. Also, a few Sama/recarms\
won't hurt, and are probably necessary.\
\
Belzaboul has an immense attack range, but it takes a while for his turn to\
come up. Take advantage of that time as follows.\
\
Once you kill two teams OR attack Belzaboul, the battle changes. Make sure that\
whatever you chose to crack (that isn't on Belzaboul), you crack within those\
two teams you kill. The reason why is afterwards, all the remaining teams\
change into Maggots. Yes, very charming. They're far more dangerous than run-\
of-the-mill demons, as they have the Spawn almighty attack. This'll deal damage\
and have a fairly good chance of spawning eggs on the target, which is a status\
ailment indicated by a little bug.\
\
This is why you need all those teams with the ability to not just heal, but\
cure. A few very short turns after, the eggs'll hatch and deal damage, usually\
killing their host, and it'll spawn a new team of maggots on the map. So fun.\
Belzaboul also has Spawn now, so you can't really avoid it. Just cure whoever\
gets afflicted as quickly as possible, and revive who you need to, as you're\
probably not going to be able to avoid several party members dying.\
\
So, Belzaboul. Again, don't attack it until after the Maggots appear to\
maximize your skill cracks. Spam almighty on it, use demons strong against\
mystic, etc. If you have anyone that reflects force, that'd help minorly. If\
the team you use to attack him has Amrita/Prayer/Affection, that'll help, as\
you have a fairly good chance of getting afflicted. Just cure your way through\
this battle and hold your ground (and towards the end, you should be able to\
keep your party members all right next to Belzaboul so he can't strike you\
without retaliation). Easily a very, very annoying battle if you let the\
Maggots get out of hand, so you'll want that cure.\
\
You'll get about 2950 EXP and 2400 Macca at the end.\

\
\
I'd advise you to crack Victory Cry off Belberith and three of the four\
available auto skills off the Believers (especially Rage Soul and Grace).\
Unless you still don't have Samarecarm and Mediarahan, in which case.\
\
Phantasm or Flight would be pretty helpful for this battle, as you could then\
pass through the obstacles/looping area where you deploy. Then, with the\
bridges sealed off, you'll have to send two teams to the control area (the\
consoles must be activated simultaneously), and two teams to either end to wait\
for the bridges to go up. If you have Phantasm/Flight, put it on the teams\
heading towards the consoles, as they'll be able to leap up onto the altar and\
fight Belberith without having to double all the way back around. Devil Speed's\
the next best choice.\
\
You also want to put Ma/zandyne and Almighty abilities on your main Belberith\
attackers. Physical fighters with Pierce are also good.\
\
Get within three spaces of the Believers and they will move to attack you.\
Otherwise, they won't move. The two Believers on the sides will make their\
COMPs go berserk upon defeat, creating those red demon-generating spaces where\
they were standing. When you defeat the two Believers standing on the switch\
activation spots, a reinforcement each will appear on the red spaces by\
Belberith. You'll probably want to pick up those COMPs to stop the\
reinforcements, especially if you're struggling here.\
\
Against the Believer with Rage Soul, you'll want a team that has Devil Speed\
(for the +15 initiative), insane agility, or a ton of phys resist fighters,\
otherwise that team's going to hit you real hard. And don't forget the teams\
that have Barrier and Wall and accidentally use really powerful phys or magic\
that'll just reflect on you. You might want to send your physical fighter\
toward the Barrier user and vice versa; note that Barrier does not block\
Almighty, at least.\
\
Belberith is way down below in the turn order, as you'll probably get to move\
two or three times before his first attack. Unfortunately, he can target anyone\
he likes, so you can't really do anything about that. In my case he always went\
after Yuzu, which I suspect is because of her Magic Yang ability. (Yeah, who\
knows.) If one of your teams is pretty weakened, though, he'll definitely\
target them, so be warned.\
\
Belberith's weak to force and has Maziodyne and Mabufudyne. So, no demons that\
are weak to elec or ice. If you have any that can reflect, that's even better.\
Victory Cry will heal a good chunk of HP and MP, so you want to be dealing a\
good 500 damage or so every time you engage him at the least. Though, if you\
have a souped-up magic-oriented MC and/or Yuzu, either of them with Holy Dance\
should easily hit for 500-ish damage on their own. A Megami with Holy Dance\
will do just as much damage, if not more (and you really should have Norn or\
Amaterasu by now, anyway).\
\
By the way, if you need to fuse Holy Dance onto anyone, just buy a few Ym with\
Watchful. Let them get experience (especially if they haven't learned Holy\
Dance yet), fuse them into a Mitama that'll get some experience, and fuse it to\
whatever demon. You'll get Holy Dance, +3 Strength, and maybe a boost to other\
stats as well. Not a bad deal when you make this much Macca at this point.\
\
You'll earn about 3200 EXP and 2800 Macca at the end.\
\
\
   NOTE: The free battle at the top of the Hills building can net you an\
         awesome skill crack. Shiva, a Deity, appears very, very rarely - I'd\
         say about 5% of the time or so - but he has Megidolaon and Victory\
         Cry. This is definitely where you want to get Megidolaon from, so.\
         Keep fighting/retreating from/restarting the free battle until you\
         see it.\

\
This battle's drastically different from the other Babel fights. It's closest\
to the one on Atsuro's route, though. A few important things: Atsuro's required\
(hopefully you've been using him, as he will be -very- useful here), and during\
the second phase of the battle, you -do not get to use any demons-. This was\
why I advised against using Black Frost - he disappears before the second phase\
begins. More on it later, though.\
\
If you're on NG+, you should have it way easier. If you're not...this battle,\
unless you grinded a ton, requires careful planning.\
\
So, final battle. Be prepared, obviously. No wimpy demons (yours should all be\
pretty high-tier, maybe with average base levels in the mid-50s - if you're on\
New Game+, though, you should easily have some base level 60s), because you do\
not have the MP to be wasting on Samarecarm every other turn in this battle. \
Have a few Tyrant- (if you've unlocked Loki, here's a great battle for him) and\
Divine-type demons (Kazfiel, Remiel) to keep your MP up. You'll be using things\
like Holy Dance a ton in this battle, and you don't want to run out. Having a\
Deity (Shiva, Asura) with Awakening to up the strength of your Almighty attacks\
can help, too. And obviously you want healing and cure.\
\
You want to put single-target -Dynes on your team leaders for the second phase,\
as Babel's weaknesses will shift (elec, force, and then phys). MP conservation\
will be important, so make sure you're using Drain, Mana Aid, Victory Cry, and\
Magic Yang. Someone'll get two of these, so Mana Aid/Magic Yang might be the\
ones you'd want to combo. Give this person or your Drain user Holy Dance.\
Atsuro should definitely be decked out with Deathbound, Phys Jump, and Pierce -\
he'll be crucial to taking down the final form. Also, because he'll be\
Deathbounding it up, make sure he either has Drain Hit/Life Lift. Or, have\
Mediarahan/Prayer/Diarahan. If you have a spot and you think you'll have\
problems with mana, definitely put Diarahan on someone.\
\
So, first phase of the battle, first. Keep a unit to Haru's right - one Ganesha\
team will otherwise land on it before you can stop it, and if it touches Haru,\
she's dead. I left Atsuro there to deal with it. Haru'll basically be following\
Atsuro around the entire first phase, so make sure you're always moving four\
steps in front of her to take advantage of her movement range of 3. Depending\
on how strong your teams are, you'll need 1-2 other teams on that side,\
surrounding Haru (to keep Ganesha/Behemoths from getting the jump on her) and\
defeating everything quickly. Be careful with Atsuro, especially if you don't\
have Phys Repel on him - might want to slap Fire Dance or something on him, so\
he can fight the Murmur teams.\
\
About every three turns or so two reinforcements will appear in the northwest\
and northeast red circles. Unfortunately, they're not those demon-spawning\
squares caused by COMPs that you can pick up, so get used to them. Be glad you\
don't have to refight the whole Bel gauntlet this time, really.\
\
Once Atsuro gets to the console, Haru'll have to reach the leftmost of the\
three spaces. Do that and upload the song successfully, and Babel will appear.\
Haru will leave once her role's done, so you won't have to keep protecting her\
any more. You'll also be able to use Atsuro again whenever his turn comes\
around.\
\
The first Babel form shouldn't be too hard. Rush it, spam almighty and/or\
characters with pierce, and it should go down quickly. However, you might want\
to make sure your team leaders are healed up with as much MP as possible,\
especially towards the end of the battle, in preparation for the second phase.\
So, let your demons do most of the fighting.\
\
Once that's done, Babel will split open and you'll be able to fight it. Before\
then, you'll lose all your demons and Black Frost, if you have him. Time to go\
it alone. Babel's now got an infinite attack range and a new repertoire that,\
while lacking in passives, includes Megidolaon. Did I mention your teams are\
all solo?\
\
Babel does have a weakness to elec for...about the first turn or so (otherwise\
it'll switch to force, and then phys), and Atsuro + pierce will blow through\
his HP. Of course, you should still be spamming almighty as well. Otherwise,\
this is a huge battle of endurance. Suspend here and there, because dealing\
with Megidolaon is not particularly fun.\
\
Phew, the end. Now that that's over, enjoy the ending in which you manage to\
thwart everyone's expectations and are generally awesome.\

\
After you make your choice, you'll lose Yuzu, Midori, and Keisuke as party\
members, and you'll gain Naoya and Kaido. You'll also get Mari and Black Frost\
if you fulfilled their respective requirements.\
\
If you knew beforehand that you wanted this route, I'd recommend trying to use\
the MC and Atsuro more on Day 6, as Yuzu, Midori, and Keisuke all leave, and\
because this'll make Naoya's, Kaido's, etc starting levels all a bit higher.\
That's because their starting levels are affected by what your party's levels\
are, so if you mostly used the MC and Atsuro, and since those other three leave\
your party before the rest join...etc.\
\
Otherwise. Highly recommend that you use Naoya - he's a good Magic-type\
replacement for Yuzu and he's required for several battles - and Mari, as she's\
the only other magic-oriented character. If you want to go against Lucifer in\
this playthrough...well, definitely use her. Or it'll be tough.\
\
Remember, even if your team leaders are at comparable levels to the enemies\
you're fighting, you have to remember your demons as well. Really, really.\
Always keep them up-to-date. If you're really struggling, that's probably why.\

\
This is your only chance to crack Magic Yin, so you kinda might want to get\
that. If it\'92s your first playthrough, there are so many skills here for the\
taking that you might get overwhelmed. You want Mediarahan and Samarecarm, if\
you can; the Wall and Barrier auto skills can wait.\
\
So, all your enemies have a ranged attack. This could get messy if you don\'92t\
move carefully...especially since everyone\'92s range overlaps. The Evil Wave\
users will have 3 movement and 2 range \'96 so with 5 spaces, you\'92ll have to move\
within their range if you want to attack them (they don\'92t move otherwise).\
Unless you have someone with Flight...who\'92ll get swarmed really quickly.\
\
Other fun thing \'96 some of your enemies have Barrier (auto reflect phys) and\
Wall (auto reflect magic). So you don\'92t want your physical fighter (should be\
Atsuro, honestly \'96 he\'92s more versatile than Kaido) going after the guys with\
Wall. Equip whatever almighty skills you have, since Barrier can\'92t block that.\
Also note the Ban Force and Ban Fire-wielding foes.\
\
So. Split your force in two. Have two people go around and to the left, and two\
around and to the right (Atsuro should be one of these to evade Wall), and\
begin slowly luring out individual Believers. If you have someone with a\
Dragon- or Vile-type, that's fine; let them be the lure, so you\'92ll at least\
deal some damage. Constantly heal, obviously; resistance to ice will also be\
good against all those Ma/bufudyne-wielding Culebres. Let them attack you,\
heal, and then take advantage of how you'll have Extra Turns while they won't\
to quickly defeat them.\
\
The Believers move somewhat erratically, but basically if you move so that\
you\'92re within striking range of one of them, they\'92ll back up if possible. If\
you\'92re right on the outside of their five-square attack range, they will move\
towards you. So, don\'92t move farther than that if you can\'92t handle it. When\
Amane gets within your range, even if they\'92re backed up and you\'92re within\
striking range, they will move to attack you. Amane won\'92t move. If you\'92re\
hurting, leave her for last.\
\
Actually, really leave her for last \'96 Amane has insane magic. Combined with\
Magic Yin, this means you\'92ll be hurting. And you\'92ll find it hard to deal magic\
damage to her (even almighty). Of course, if you brought along that unit with\
Evil Wave/Chaos Wave, this is a really good place to use it, as Amane\'92s the\
only unit without a ranged attack. You can eliminate her demons and strike\
without worrying about Magic Yin.\
\
If not, try to get rid of her Rangda if you can first. If you happen to have\
someone with Gigajama, this might be a good time to use it on Amane. Then with\
Rangda gone, your physical units might have a chance at severely damaging her\
enough. If they have Phys Repel, though, they should be able to use Attack All/\
Deathbound/whatever without getting backlash from the Rangda. Note that Amane\
has Mediarahan and Mana Aid, so you\'92re in for a long fight.\
\
Remiel, a Divine-type fusion, will also be unlocked in the Cathedral of Shadows\
after this battle.\
\
You'll get about 2200 EXP and 1500 Macca at the end.\

First, you can walk on the molten lava, but you will take fire damage from\
"Fanatic's Lava" at the end of your turn (ow). But, unless you have Evil Wave\
or Chaos Wave, you'll have to stand on it to attack Jezebel. So you might want\
all the str/null/reflect fire you can have on the teams that'll go after her.\
That or use Animal Leg to move back onto not-lava-covered ground.\
\
The Decarabias won't move towards you unless you're in their range. So. Unless\
you have a team that nulls fire and can afford to spend a turn or so traversing\
the lava, have your teams go around it and take care of the Decarabias. And\
note Jezebel's 3x range, and move accordingly. She tends to use Maragidyne,\
which is another good reason to have Null/Reflect fire. She'll also whip out\
Judgement a few times, so you'll need to keep healing and/or be strong against\
Mystic while you're at it.\
\
Damage Jezebel enough and the place will revert back to a flowery garden\
(meaning no lava to worry about). You'll also snap Amane out of her stupor.\
Jezebel will summon up three doppelgangers of Amane (Mind Amanes). If Amane\
gets possessed again, it's the end, so you'll have to defeat them and protect\
her. Note that even if you defeat the Mind Amanes, they'll just keep spawning\
so that there'll always be at least two on the map. So, you'll have to focus\
your energy on Jezebel. And if the Mind Amane teams are slaughtering you (with\
Cerberus's Deathbound and Ukano Mitama's Ma-dyne skills, this might be), really\
focus all your energy on Jezebel and hold out as best as you can.\
\
Interestingly enough, the Mind Amane teams give far more EXP than Jezebel does.\
Ah well. In fact, if you're on NG+ and you're looking for a place to grind\
besides/before the Lucifer battle, this isn't bad for it - a Mind Amane team\
will give you about 8000+ EXP a pop, and they easily and quickly respawn.\
Better than a free battle, at least.\
\
You'll receive about 2300 EXP and 1500 Macca at the end.\

\
\
A Kishin-type boss. (Four Devas is basically Kishin's Double Up + Genma's\
Phantasm sans the lowered movement cost.) At level 65. Could be painful, so get\
ready.\
\
One reinforcement team appears every few turns or so. Cerberus has high Agility\
and Yaksa has a devastating Deathbound, so you might want to get rid of them\
with a strong ice user if you can. Ice and Almighty will also work wonders\
against Bishamon.\
\
The Rangda teams are going to be pure misery for your physical fighter (Atsuro,\
Kaido, or both) and/or physical-attack demons. So be careful with your multi-\
target physical attacks. It might be better to send a team of them towards\
Bishamon instead, especially if they have high Vitality, which you're going to\
want against him. Pierce would help against his resistance to phys, too (unless\
they can wield Ice attacks).\
\
Lucky for you, if Bishamon attacks twice, he'll be pushed pretty far down in\
the turn order and you won't have to worry about him initiating attacks for a\
while. Send some strong Ice users (Culebre would work really well here, with\
Ma/bufudyne and Evil Wave, preventing you from getting hit), and pace yourself.\
The moment one of your teams gets severely damaged, get it away from Bishamon\
and healed up quickly. With Attack All + Dual Shadow, a fluke could send you\
flying.\
\
But yes. Definitely have a few users with Sama/recarm if possible, and major\
healing abilities. You can try putting Ban Phys on the team with your weakest\
(vitality-wise) demons for a little help.\
\
(By the way, if you've decided to use Izuna...well, you should definitely be\
using Atsuro no matter what - he's required in the final battle. Just saying.)\
\
You'll earn about 2500 EXP and 1800 Macca at the end.\

\
\
As if the not-so-subtle "I have a feeling we should be careful" and "are you\
ready?" messages weren't enough warning, you get to fight two Devas here.\
\
There are a crapload of enemies, but most of them have elemental weaknesses\
that you can easily take advantage of. In particular, someone with strong elec-\
type attacks should go towards Koumoku, and someone with force towards Zouchou.\
Have all the Ma-dynes equipped to make it easier on yourself, as all the teams\
have two of the same demon (and thus twice the susceptibility), with the\
exception of the Devas' teams. You might want to send your physical attacker/s\
towards the Yaksa and not the Rangda. Actually, forget the "might" part.\
\
Otherwise, both Devas are noticeably weaker than Bishamon, and don't have as\
many resistances or annoying passives. Still, both of them have Evil Wave, so\
couple that with Double Up and you might get hit pretty hard if you're not\
prepared. Be patient and don't let the enemies get the jump on you, and kill\
the Culebres when you get a chance. Just move cautiously and keep yourself\
healed, and this should go pretty smoothly.\
\
You'll earn about 2700 EXP and 2100 Macca at the end.\

\
\
So. Charming bug thing aside. Doesn't look like a particularly tough battle\
with anything strange to throw at you, and you get a nice choice of skills to\
crack, right?\
\
Yeah, well. Have a magic user with a lot of MP crack Prayer during this battle\
and set it (if you don't have it already). Have a Megami or two. And give\
someone like Atsuro Amrita. You'll see why later. Also, a few Sama/recarms\
won't hurt, and are probably necessary.\
\
Belzaboul has an immense attack range, but it takes a while for his turn to\
come up. Take advantage of that time as follows.\
\
Once you kill two teams OR attack Belzaboul, the battle changes. Make sure that\
whatever you chose to crack (that isn't on Belzaboul), you crack within those\
two teams you kill. The reason why is afterwards, all the remaining teams\
change into Maggots. Yes, very charming. They're far more dangerous than run-\
of-the-mill demons, as they have the Spawn almighty attack. This'll deal damage\
and have a fairly good chance of spawning eggs on the target, which is a status\
ailment indicated by a little bug.\
\
This is why you need all those teams with the ability to not just heal, but\
cure. A few very short turns after, the eggs'll hatch and deal damage, usually\
killing their host, and it'll spawn a new team of maggots on the map. So fun.\
Belzaboul also has Spawn now, so you can't really avoid it. Just cure whoever\
gets afflicted as quickly as possible, and revive who you need to, as you're\
probably not going to be able to avoid several party members dying.\
\
So, Belzaboul. Again, don't attack it until after the Maggots appear to\
maximize your skill cracks. Spam almighty on it, use demons strong against\
mystic, etc. If you have anyone that reflects force, that'd help minorly. If\
the team you use to attack him has Amrita/Prayer/Affection, that'll help, as\
you have a fairly good chance of getting afflicted. Just cure your way through\
this battle and hold your ground (and towards the end, you should be able to\
keep your party members all right next to Belzaboul so he can't strike you\
without retaliation). Easily a very, very annoying battle if you let the\
Maggots get out of hand, so you'll want that cure.\
\
You'll get about 2950 EXP and 2400 Macca at the end.\

Victory:\
Defeat all angels\

Sariel Lv: 62\
Anael Lv: 62\
\
\
If you missed out on cracking Mediarahan and Samarecarm, here's another great\
opportunity to get those. Skill-wise, you'll want all the Almighty moves you\
can equip. And definitely put Pierce on your phys attacker, as all of the\
angels have phys resist. Oh, and get all the mystic resistance you can, too.\
\
So, look at all those clusters of angels around you. Pretty painful. If your\
teams aren\'92t so strong/under-leveled, you might want to have them move together\
in one big mass around the map. Otherwise, split your forces in half and go\
left and right. Have your pairs eliminate the angels team by team, and make\
sure you keep everyone's HP up.\
\
Note that you do want to thoroughly eliminate the teams, as the Kazfiels are\
packing Samarecarm, and the Aniels and Norns have Mediarahan and Prayer. If you\
let them constantly heal this will drag on forever, so don't.\
\
Also make sure you have enough MP. Sariel will use Purging Light from time to\
time, which will hit everyone on the map for MP damage. It's a mystic-type\
attack, so if you have Anti-/Null Mystic on your team leaders and demons, that\
will definitely help. (Plus, the angels are packing Judgement - which halves\
(or quarters, in the case of your team leaders) your HP.\
\
Anael and Sariel will move towards you, unfortunately. Be really careful -\
Anael has Makarakarn, so Almighty will be good against him. His Attack All will\
hurt, so keep healed. Sariel has Beast Eye, which means you can expect him to\
cast Tetrakarn every fight. So, since you can't Pierce through phys reflect,\
don't send Atsuro or Kaido towards him at all and have them take care of Anael.\
\
If you're taking way too much damage, you might want to resort to using Evil or\
Chaos Wave users, provided that your teams can do enough damage without Extra\
Turns. Or you might do a one-two kind of strategy where the distance attacker\
goes first, and then another fighter finishes the team off and takes much less\
damage than they would've otherwise.\
\
You'll get about 3050 EXP and 2600 Macca at the end.\

\
\
I'd advise you to crack Victory Cry off Belberith and three of the four\
available auto skills off the Believers (especially Rage Soul and Grace).\
Unless you still don't have Samarecarm and Mediarahan, in which case.\
\
Phantasm or Flight would be pretty helpful for this battle, as you could then\
pass through the obstacles/looping area where you deploy. Then, with the\
bridges sealed off, you'll have to send two teams to the control area (the\
consoles must be activated simultaneously), and two teams to either end to wait\
for the bridges to go up. If you have Phantasm/Flight, put it on the teams\
heading towards the consoles, as they'll be able to leap up onto the altar and\
fight Belberith without having to double all the way back around. Devil Speed's\
the next best choice.\
\
You also want to put Ma/zandyne and Almighty abilities on your main Belberith\
attackers. Physical fighters with Pierce are also good.\
\
Get within three spaces of the Believers and they will move to attack you.\
Otherwise, they won't move. The two Believers on the sides will make their\
COMPs go berserk upon defeat, creating those red demon-generating spaces where\
they were standing. When you defeat the two Believers standing on the switch\
activation spots, a reinforcement each will appear on the red spaces by\
Belberith. You'll probably want to pick up those COMPs to stop the\
reinforcements, especially if you're struggling here.\
\
Against the Believer with Rage Soul, you'll want a team that has Devil Speed\
(for the +15 initiative), insane agility, or a ton of phys resist fighters,\
otherwise that team's going to hit you real hard. And don't forget the teams\
that have Barrier and Wall and accidentally use really powerful phys or magic\
that'll just reflect on you. You might want to send your physical fighter\
toward the Barrier user and vice versa; note that Barrier does not block\
Almighty, at least.\
\
Belberith is way down below in the turn order, as you'll probably get to move\
two or three times before his first attack. Unfortunately, he can target anyone\
he likes, so you can't really do anything about that. If one of your teams is\
pretty weakened, he'll definitely target them, so be warned.\
\
Belberith's weak to force and has Maziodyne and Mabufudyne. So, no demons that\
are weak to elec or ice. If you have any that can reflect, that's even better.\
Victory Cry will heal a good chunk of HP and MP, so you want to be dealing a\
good 500 damage or so every time you engage him at the least. Though, if you\
have a souped-up magic-oriented MC and/or Yuzu, either of them with Holy Dance\
should easily hit for 500-ish damage on their own. A Megami with Holy Dance\
will do just as much damage, if not more (and you really should have Norn or\
Amaterasu by now, anyway).\
\
By the way, if you need to fuse Holy Dance onto anyone, just buy a few Ym with\
Watchful. Let them get experience (especially if they haven't learned Holy\
Dance yet), fuse them into a Mitama that'll get some experience, and fuse it to\
whatever demon. You'll get Holy Dance, +3 Strength, and maybe a boost to other\
stats as well. Not a bad deal when you make this much Macca at this point.\
\
You'll earn about 3200 EXP and 2800 Macca at the end.\
\
\
   NOTE: The free battle at the top of the Hills building can net you an\
         awesome skill crack. Shiva, a Deity, appears very, very rarely - I'd\
         say about 5% of the time or so - but he has Megidolaon and Victory\
         Cry. This is definitely where you want to get Megidolaon from, so.\
         Keep fighting/retreating from/restarting the free battle until you\
         see it.\

So, final battle. Be prepared, obviously. No wimpy demons (yours should all be\
pretty high-tier, maybe with average base levels in the mid-50s - if you're on\
New Game+, though, you should easily have some base level 60s), because you do\
not have the MP to be wasting on Samarecarm every other turn in this battle. \
Have a few Tyrant- (if you've unlocked Loki, here's a great battle for him) and\
Divine-type demons (Kazfiel, Remiel) to keep your MP up. You'll be using things\
like Holy Dance a ton in this battle, and you don't want to run out. Having a\
Deity (Shiva, Asura) with Awakening to up the strength of your Almighty attacks\
can help, too. And obviously you want healing and cure.\
\
Oh, and put Ma/ziodyne on your main magic-using attackers. Along with the usual\
Almighty, etc. Babel's final form is weak to elec. You might also want to put\
Ma/zandyne on a few people, as well.\
\
About every three turns or so two reinforcements will appear in the northwest\
and northeast red circles. Unfortunately, they're not those demon-spawning\
squares caused by COMPs that you can pick up, so get used to them.\
\
The first Babel form shouldn't be too hard. Rush it, spam almighty and/or\
characters with pierce, and it should go down quickly.\
\
Once that's done, Babel shows its true form. Well, not quite - it summons Beldr\
and Belial, first of all. Oh yeah. And yep, only the MC can damage Belial. All\
of your teams will be clustered around the organ in the center.\
\
Don't worry about having a Kishin on the MC \'96 Beldr has low HP, and if you're\
at a good level, he won't be a problem at all. And Belial's still weak to ice.\
Defeat them, and a ramp will appear leading to Babel \'96 with Jezebel guarding\
it. This'll lead to a series of fights \'96 first her, then Beelzebub, then\
Belberith. Don't worry about Beelzebub's spawn \'96 once you defeat it, the\
ailment will disappear from anyone who had it. If you defeat it fast enough,\
that is.\
\
All the Bels have the same resistances and weaknesses that they did the first\
time you fought them. So implement the same strategies you used before, etc.\
\
After all that, Babel will split open and you'll be able to fight it. It's now\
got an infinite attack range and a new repertoire that includes Megidolaon. \
Basically you'll want to be kind of careful at this point. If you have a slow\
healer in your lineup, you can have them heal on the assumption that Babel'll\
deal pretty bad damage with Megidolaon or Attack All, especially if Babel has\
an Extra Turn.\
\
Babel does have a weakness to elec, and Atsuro/Kaido + pierce will blow through\
his Str to phys. Of course, you should still be spamming almighty as well.\
Otherwise, this is a huge battle of endurance. Suspend here and there, because\
dealing with a Dual Shadow'd Megidolaon is not particularly fun.\
\
And...the end. Congrats, you're now the overlord. Enjoy your new evil\
expression (really?) and your awesome black cape.\

of them.\
\
You should probably be at level 50+ for this battle. By this point you should\
also be seriously upgrading your demons. (It'd be really good to have, say, a\
Tyrant or two, Laksmi, Culebre, and so on.) The Yaksa teams will give you a\
harder time than Loki will, in all likelihood. Yay Deathbound when you're not\
the one using it.\
\
Send two people straight up the center with strong Agi skills. The other two\
team members should back them up, taking care of the Seiryuu-Yaksa teams with\
Zan.\
\
Watch out for Loki \'96 if you move within four spaces of him or you wipe out all\
four demon teams below him, he and the Laksmi will move towards you. In\
addition, he'll create three copies of himself. Honestly, the copies shouldn't\
give you too much trouble \'96 my Lv: 50 Atsuro killed one copy in one go with\
Deathbound. Plus they give pretty nice EXP. Loki will regenerate his copies\
after several turns, though.\
\
You can tell which one's the real Loki by finding the one that has a shadow -\
the copies don't. If the one you attack says "good job, you found me" (or\
Atsuro couldn't kill him on his own, as was in my case, haha), then you've\
found the real one.\
\
After your MC goes twice, two Yaksa teams appear at the bottom. One has an\
Abaddon, which has chaos wave, so be careful about that. Just don't get ganged\
up on by the Lokis and you should be all right.\
\
   NOTE: Having a hard time? Just because your team leaders are at okay\
         levels and you're using good strategy isn't everything. Make\
         sure you have the latest demons. If you're walking into these\
         battles with demons at levels...oh, early 40s and lower, you\
         might have a hard time.\

\
\
So, at first glance, the battle doesn't look -too- bad. Just like what the\
easiest route's final battle should be. ...Then Amane and Izuna show up (either\
after your team goes twice, or you kill all the demon teams). Hopefully your\
demons are up to par - I had Hecate and Astaroth, a Culebre or two, Laksmi, and\
Cerberus, among others, which made the battle go by much better.\
\
First little note: at the beginning, Sariel uses Purging Light, which is a\
target-all attack that hits your MP. Ouch. It's a Mystic-type attack, so your\
team should have pretty good resistance to that by now. Keeping around demons\
with Tyranny, Blood Wine, and Drain should also help. (Be sure to put Drain on\
your strongest magic-using team leader.)\
\
If you're unprepared, you will get slaughtered. Amane has Samarecarm and can\
revive demon teams you've already killed, and Izuna's Chaos Wave can down you\
before you have a chance to attack. So your priority in this battle is actually\
to eliminate the reinforcements when they appear.\
\
Thus. Fight all the demons close by - take note of Kazfiel's annoying\
Samarecarm - but keep at least three teams near the entrance, where Amane and\
Izuna will show up. You'll want two people with Evil Wave (preferably) to take\
on Amane, and one particularly heavy hitter to go after Izuna. Not Atsuro - her\
team reflects or nulls physical attacks. Getting rid of Izuna's Arioch should\
be the first priority, as you won't have to worry about Chaos Wave any more.\
After that, do as you will.\
\
With Amane, Evil Wave is the safer approach. Norn has Prayer and several\
Ma-dyne attacks, and Amane has Megidolaon. Not fun to be hit with. But the\
really annoying thing about fighting her is her Grace auto ability - it fully\
heals her team (doesn't revive, thankfully) every turn. So you'll want to knock\
out her demons first and then try to eliminate Amane in one turn. I managed\
with Atsuro who had a Deathbound-laden team for the latter part. If you need\
to Drain her MP, that's fine as well.\
\
Otherwise. You'll probably get hit by another round of Purging Light, and\
Sariel and Anael will move if you get too close. Evil Wave will help whittle\
them down while maintaining a safe distance, and Tyranny will slow down their\
turns. With Beast Eye, Sariel will use Tetrakarn every fight, and Anael\
sometimes uses Makarakarn, so attack accordingly. (Remember, shields and\
reflects don't do anything against Almighty-type.) Overall, the battle can be\
immensely challenging - if you don't know what's coming.\
\
And yep, that's the end of Yuzu's route. Enjoy the ending...well, it's not\
particularly cheery, but you know what I mean. Yay New Game+?\

\
SMT games are ever so fond of having that one hard-to-beat optional boss\
towards the end, and Devil Survivor's no exception. So, meet Lucifer, a big,\
blue Tyrant who only shows up on the Last Day on New Game+, on all routes\
except Yuzu's. Did I mention he's at level 99?\
\
Note that my HP/MP estimates of 9999 might be off by a few hundred. But hey,\
that's what you get that in-game orange bar for, right...?\

\
Before you ask, yes, it gets really, really hard with each passing phase. Phase\
2 starts when you whittle him down to about 60-65% of his HP, and Phase 3 when\
he's down to 20%. He heals fully each time. No, you can't stop him.\
\
It'd be better not to fight this battle on Naoya's or Kaido's routes. I'd\
definitely recommend against doing so if you didn't get Mari and/or your MC's\
not a magic nuke (high magic and agility) - with just Naoya having the ability\
to use Almighty, you'll be screwed. It'll definitely be possible to fight him\
on the route if you have at least the MC and Naoya geared for powerful magic,\
depending on your strategy.\
\
If you know it's the playthrough you're fighting him, be sure to use magic-\
oriented characters. Definitely soup up the MC's stats. Yuzu and Midori are\
good choices, Amane's not as good as Yuzu but depending on your strategy, as\
good as Midori, and Atsuro or Gin will be helpful for the first two phases\
plus getting rid of reinforcements. Basically, the team leaders should have\
good magic and agility. Amane doesn't quite have great agility, and Izuna's\
lack of magic means she'll basically die from Megidoladyne. Up to you.\
\
Otherwise, I'd advise fighting Lucifer during your last playthrough - saves a\
bit of grinding. Depending on your strategy, you'll want your demons and team\
leaders to be in their high 70s at the very, very, very least, mid-to-upper\
80s, or, well, 99. If you're in high 70s, you'll need magic above 30.\
More later.\
\
The major challenge to this fight is...well. Starting Phase Two, Lucifer will\
drop Megidoladyne on you, which is as nasty as it sounds - an Almighty attack\
that hits everyone on the map. It does more damage each time it's used, \
increasing by...well, from what I observed, about 50% with each strike. The\
first strike alone will kill your teams if they're not at least level 82 (Yuzu,\
Naoya, and a magic nuke MC might last in their late 70s). So, pretty much by\
the time the third Megidoladyne rolls around (which Lucifer will use often),\
you're pretty much dead.\
\
Here's a breakdown of the three phases:\
\
-- Phase 1: Lucifer doesn't attack until you attack him first. And then he only\
   attacks once per turn. No big deal, even if he has infinite range.\
-- Phase 2: Lucifer's turn automatically comes up, and he'll launch\
   Megidoladyne. Ouch. He now has Dragon Eye, meaning 3x attacks per turn.\
   And no, it's not a typo - his Hassohappa really does anywhere from 4000 to\
   over 9000 damage. However, he doesn't have Pierce any more, so any kind of\
   Phys defense will save you there.\
-- Phase 3: Argh, he healed again. And still uses Megidoladyne. And...has Phys\
   -Repel-, and Elec Drain + Maziodyne. You don't want Elec Repel equipped\
   because of this phase. Oh, he also has Drain. So, be sure you have Blood\
   Wine, Tyranny, Mana Aid, Victory Cry, etc. Or Drain, if he didn't suck up\
   all of your MP. ...And he still has Dragon Eye.\
\
So. You have three options: 1) Grind to level 99 and slug it out, 2) Tyrant\
lock strategy, 3) Recarm strategy.\
\
Option 1...if you want, and you have the time and aren't bored by grinding, go\
ahead. Megidoladyne might still kill you, though. Your entire team will have\
to be armed with Phys Drain/Repel, and you'll have to use very strong magic\
users. Gigajama could help to keep you alive, as long as you put it on a demon\
that'll move before Lucifer does. If that team has Phys Repel/Drain/Null,\
you'll definitely survive. (This would work better with Tyrant Lock, too.)\
\
Option 2. You need at least two Tyrants to make this work, obviously. This can\
also slightly work in conjunction with the Recarm strategy. Unless you grinded\
massively with Hecate, the two demons will be Loki and Astaroth (and some say\
using Astaroth uses too much grinding also, up to you). Basically, put the\
Tyrants on your two best magic users, who'll spend the whole battle primarily\
fighting Lucifer/trying to survive his attacks. (Gigajama + Phys resistance\
will be really good for that.) Pair at least one of the Tyrants with a Kishin,\
who can Double Up. Tyranny delays foes' turns, so if you keep pushing Lucifer's\
turn back, he won't be able to use Megidoladyne, and you'll be safe from that.\
...Not that this guarantees you'll survive three hits of Megidolaon or\
Hassohappa, but.\
\
Option 3. Some people call it cheap; some people say it's a legit strategy. It\
definitely allows for the least amount of grinding, though, but you'll have to\
watch your stats and abuse suspends liberally (granted, you'll be doing that\
no matter what strategy you're using, but). Lucifer's agility is 28. If you're\
initiating all the fights, your agility can be somewhere around 26 and ideally\
at 30. Your two demons should have 32 agility at least - just needs to be\
higher than the team leader's. You need two teams that'll do this. Yuzu will\
hit 26 agility somewhere in the mid-80s, which should be good enough - you\
might have to reset a few times if/when the RNG hates you, but otherwise.\
\
Oh, and the skills. Your two team leaders should have Recarm/Samarecarm, and\
your demons should have Drain/holy Dance/Recarm. Those'll be the MC and Yuzu\
(or Naoya - the other magic users aren't going to be fast enough), basically.\
And you want a Pierce+Phys Jump'ing Atsuro.\
\
The recarm strategy basically takes advantage of the fact that recarm'd teams\
automatically go right after, turn-wise. So, if team 1 dies, team 2 recarms,\
attacks, and dies, team 1 goes right after, recarms team 2, attacks, and dies,\
and it keeps repeating. This is why you need high agility - your team's two\
demons will attack with Holy Dance/Drain, and - in phase two, your team will\
attack and you'll hope Lucifer's attack kills the leader only (that or you have\
enough recarm power to revive a whole team) - but in phase three, your leader\
will attack with Mighty Hit or Deathbound, which should repel back on them and\
kill them - before Lucifer can attack. Basically, you'll never let him attack\
or use Megidoladyne, and you'll keep chipping him down. AWesome, right?\
\
Note that for this to work, the two team leaders obviously can't have Phys\
Null, Drain, or Repel (Lucifer doesn't have Pierce in the last two phases).\
\
So the strategy's basically to whittle Lucifer down to the second phase, where\
Atsuro and the other teams will bludgeon him to 20% HP, and then where the two\
recarm teams' leaders will keep killing themselves via phys repel while you\
slowly get his HP down.\
\
Tyrant lock can inadvertently work with this, a bit - it acts like a Double Up\
of sorts, after all, letting your Tyrants drive Lucifer's turn way back.\
\
Note that the strategy's not perfect - in her upper 80s, my Yuzu's Deathbound\
couldn't do enough damage to kill herself. This is why you want Recarm, not\
Samarecarm - your chars might not be strong enough to kill themselves\
otherwise, which'll leave you open to Megidolaon, Hassohappa, or Drain. Plus\
it saves MP.\
\
So, a few bullet points:\
 - Don't equip Elec Repel. You can have Fire/Ice Repel, but they'll only be\
   useful for the first part, alas.\
 - If you're using Tyrant Lock + Gigajama, equip Phys Null/Drain/Repel.\
 - If you're using Recarm, don't equip Phys Null/Drain/Repel. If not, equip.\
 - Tyranny, Blood Wine, Awakening - good stuff.\
 - You definitely should have a Megami like Amaterasu - best magic-using demon\
   race, with high MP to match.\
 - Don't bother with Vile types (Lucifer's range makes them not so useful).\
 - Recommended auto skills: you can never go wrong with Blitzkrieg. Magic Yang\
   is probably a must. Atsuro could use Full Might (-not- Rage Soul), and the\
   last one's up to you. Magic Yin, while kinda cool, might not be entirely\
   sustainable. Ban Phys or Wall could help. Do not equip Barrier.\
 - If you're not using Drain and Holy Dance, something's wrong with you.\
 - Atsuro/Gin/your physical attacker should have Pierce and Phys Jump. Their\
   attacks depend on if you're using the Recarm strategy or not.\
\
Overall, grinding's one of the most important things - the higher your level,\
the less damage Lucifer will do to you. If you have the patience to get to 99,\
good for you. If not, prepare your strategy very carefully - or don't fight the\
battle at all, as it's not really necessary. Just for completion.\
\
Oh, and you'll also get the Lucifer fusion at the end, though he comes at 99\
and will be a bit overkill by then. Still cool, though?\

In regards to where you can crack skills, I tried to include as many battle\

free battles (it's RNG, so I can't list exactly what enemies you'd encounter),\
and sometimes, enemies have different skills than they normally would.\
\
If you keep up in the game, you're bound to crack everything you can sooner or\
later. You don't need to freak out. The only things you can possibly miss out\
on permanently are Last Day auto skills, Megidolaon, and Victory Cry, really\
(and the latter two, not so much, either).\

   NOTE: In regards to Last Day skill cracks, it'll indicate which route the\

         or the Devas, and you can't fight all the free battle demons\
         (basically anything above level 56).\

 Definitely comparable with Rage Soul. An ensured Critical attack usually means\
 an ensured Extra Turn, and it can also take away enemies' Extra Turns. Plus,\
 you're not locked into Attacking all the time, and you can use things like\
 Hassohappa or Deathbound. Both abilities have their merits, essentially.]\

Ban Phys - MP: 15 - Pr: phys - Stats: St15 Vi15\
All: Null 1st Phys\
Crack: Day 6 (Tamer Cop, Azuma)\
[How this, and other Ban ___ auto skills work, is that for the first enemy who\

 Turns and give you more flexibility.]\

 you find your phys. attacking team's HP always gets dangerously low.]\

[Okay, this one's tricky. I'm not completely sure but I think it's supposed to\
 be dmg < 50, not >. If so, useful in the beginning, but not so useful later\
 on. When activated, it'll count as a 'block' and might give you Extra Turns.]\

\
Megami:\
Affection - MP: anywhere from 10-20% - Pr: heal\
Heal/Cure a team\
Range: 4\
[Easily better than Devotion or Charm, and highly recommended. It'll probably\
 heal at least 60% of each team member's HP, and it'll cure status ailments. It\
 might not be Prayer, but the range will surely help.]\
\
Deity:\
Awakening - MP: 8% - Pr: protect\
MP skills up 1.5x\
[Choose the option to increase your team's magic potency during that turn. Can\
 be quite useful, with the right combination of demons.]\
\
Vile:\
Chaos Wave - Pr: passive\
Rng up 3x, Move -1\
Cost 2x, no EX Turn\
[The movement and speed cost makes this one hard to use, unless your main has\
 a New Game+ movement of 5. Enemies with this are a royal pain, however. Pair\
 it with Animal Leg for a sniper of sorts, or Flight to cancel out the\
 movement penalty. Note that even if you attack an enemy while you're right\
 next to it, you'll never have Extra Turns if you have a demon with this.]\
\
Snake:\
Constrict - Pr: passive\
Foes near team: Bound\
Engage priority\
[You'll always have +10 Initiative when enemies attack, which gives you a\
 better chance of getting Extra Turns. It doesn't kick in when you're the one\
 attacking first. Also, enemies that are next to you have their movement\
 reduced to 1.]\
\
Dragon:\
Evil Wave - Pr: passive\
Range up 2x\
[No movement penalty makes it better than Chaos Wave in most respects - most\
 enemies won't be able to attack you, and if you're moving your teams in a\
 group, this should soften up enemies enough. Definitely good to have. Like\
 with Chaos Wave, note that even if you attack an enemy while you're right next\
 to it, you'll never have Extra Turns if you have a demon with this.]\
\
Divine:\
Blood Wine - HP: 20% - Pr: heal\
Convert HP to MP\
Level dependant\
[Pretty useful, especially if you're the kind of player who always runs out of\
 MP. Tyranny would work as well, though... The benefit to Blood Wine is that\
 it's HP- rather than battle-dependant. Usually, it doesn't restore as much MP\
 as Tyranny, in my experience, but you can always rotate around a Divine-type\
 amongst your party to restore MP in long, grueling battles.]\
\
Avian:\
Flight - Pr: passive\
Ignore obstacles\
Move +1 (No stack)\
[Good for racing to certain points, i.e. battles where you have to save\
 civilians, or battles where there's a ton of debris/obstacles.]\
\
Fallen:\
Sacrifice - Pr: passive\
HP, MP up when foe dies (Lvl dependant)\
[If the demon with Sacrifice lands the finishing blow, the entire team will get\
 a little bit of their HP and MP replenished.]\
\
Avatar:\
Switch - MP: 5% - Pr: passive\
Switch positions\
Range: 6\
[So very useful in many battles, especially the save-the-civilian ones. Not\
 only will you get closer to the enemies faster (you can move a potential 9-11\
 spaces in one turn with this trick), but you'll get the civilian out of harm's\
 way at the same time. You can also use this to move a badly damaged team out\
 of range, or string together a number of attacks by having teams Switch in,\
 etc. Very versatile, and it fits in many strategies.\
\
Beast:\
Animal Leg - Pr: passive\
Move after attacking\
(Not stackable)\
[Pretty useful, seeing as it'll double your move. If you're trying to race to a\
 certain point and there are enemies close to you at the beginning, it'll let\
 you propel your team pretty far. The speed cost for the extra movement is\
 lower than that of normal movement.]\
\
Wilder:\
Devil Speed - HP: 15-20% depending on level - Pr: passive\
Move = 7 after use\
Engage priority\
[One of the classic moves for save-the-civilian battles. A little bonus to this\
 one is its +15 Initiative you'll get when you attack after using it.]\
\
Genma:\
Phantasma - Pr: passive\
Ignore obstacles\
Move cost: Half\
[It doesn't give you the extra move that Flight does, but it helps your overall\
 Speed with the lessened movement cost. And you can move through obstacles.\
 Definitely a very handy skill to have.]\
\
Fairy:\
Charm - MP: 10-20% depending on level - Pr: heal\
Recovers HP, miracles happen\
Range: 3\
[Good at the beginning of the game, but its usefulness wanes later on.\
 Affection and even Devotion are better for ranged healing, and Media/rahan\
 will definitely heal more. Charm can, on occasion, up your Critical Hit % or\
 even heal you fully (though that last one's rare). It can also lower your\
 movement, though, so...overall, don't bother when you have better healing\
 options later.]\
\
Tyrant:\
Tyranny - Pr: passive\
MP up when damaged\
Foe turns delayed\
[One of the best, best racial skills by far. Free MP replenishment is always a\
 bonus, especially when you're using Ma-dyne skills every turn, and the foe\
 turn delay will really help when you don't want a big boss on the Last Day to\
 whip out Megidolaon as often. Just surround it with people who have Tyrant-\
 type demons and you're all set.\
\
Kishin:\
Double Up - Pr: passive\
Can normal attack 2x\
(Not stackable)\
[Another really good racial skill. You can attack twice per turn. Say you start\
 out in front of an enemy - you attack it, then move, then you attack another\
 team. It'll push you back pretty far in the battle order, though - which can\
 be helpful on certain missions, i.e. if reinforcements or enemy turns (or\
 Naoya's well-known 3-turn challenge) are solely dependant on how many times\
 the MC's gone.]\
\
Touki:\
Aggravate - HP: 13-18% depending on level - Pr: protect\
Allies: critical dmg 1 turn after use\
[Eh, kinda useful. Painful if you're up against it. Pretty good for inflicting\
 immense damage, up to a point, if it's on a team of physical attackers.]\
\
Jaki:\
Bind - HP: 15-22% depending on level - Pr: passive\
Adj. foe team: Bound\
Range: 3\
[Good for levels where you're trying to keep the enemy from escaping or you're\
 trying to protect civilians. Very good to have handy during, say, the Kudlak\
 battles.]\
\
Femme:\
Devotion - MP: 15-25% depending on level - Pr: passive\
Recovers HP\
Range: 3\
[It's pretty much just plain-vanilla healing, with some range. Healing's\
 HP-dependant - it'll heal up to half of the HP that the user demon has at the\
 moment. So if only has 50 HP left or something...it's going to be a little\
 useless. Better than Charm in many cases, not as good as Affection.]\
\
Elements and Mitamas do not have racial skills.\

\
At the beginning of the 1st day, you'll gain access to the demon auction. This\
is the only way you can get new demons for the rest of the game, aside from\
fusing - which needs demons you've bought in the auction, otherwise you'll run\
out of fusion material rather quickly. Macca's the currency used here.\
\
The auction refreshes after 30 in-game minutes, or if you reset the game.\
\
Demons have star rankings of 1 to 5, with one being the worst quality (stats\
lowered by at least 2, some skills reduced in power or eliminated), 3 being\
average, and 4 or 5 being excellent (stat boosts, higher level, better skills).\
A demon can only have a star level of 4 or 5, not both, and 1 or 2, not both.\
Basically, you can get three types of a specific demon: crappy, average, and\
good.\
\
There are four auction levels, which get unlocked as you progress throughout\
the game:\
\
 - Basic:    demons at levels 1-15\
 - Gold:     demons at levels 16-30\
 - Platinum: demons at levels 31-50\
 - Occult:   demons at levels 51+, and Mitamas\
\
\
Here's how the auction works. Pick the demon you want. You'll get the choice to\
either buy it now, or bid for it. If you bid, you can lower the price to about\
75-90% of the original value, depending on the demon's star ranking (the higher\
it is, the more expensive it'll be). You have 5 seconds to bid high enough so\
that the other bidders will drop out; the longer the auction lasts, the less\
inclined they'll be to drop out. So you generally want to end the auction by\
3.5 seconds.\
\
You can drop out of the auction at any time. If you decide to opt out of the\
auction after you've won, you won't have to pay any Macca, but your auction\
ranking will go down.\
\
A few rules and regulations:\
 - For a demon to be available in the auction, you have to have fought it at\
   least once.\
 - Unique demons (ones you can only have one copy of at one time) can't be\
   bought.\
 - Some of the 4- /5-star demons will come with skills that you can't get when\
   fusing them, so be on the lookout for that.\
\
Oh, and. Sometimes, after you place your bid, the auction will freak out on you\
and one of several things can happen:\
 - You have to pay double the original price.\
 - You only have to pay half the original price.\
 - You have to pay...nothing. (Awesome.)\
 - Turns out, you're getting a demon different from the originally specified\
   one.\
\
If something bad happens, well, at least if you default, it won't bring down\
your auction ranking. If you really wanted that demon and it got switched out,\
you can just soft reset or try again after 30 in-game minutes have passed.\

\
In the middle of the 1st Day or so, you'll gain access to the Cathedral of\
Shadows, where you can fuse demons. Unlike past SMT games, you won't get access\
to a compendium, but you do have a search function where you can look up demons\
and how to make them.\
\
Note that there are two restrictions on what will appear in your search: the\
demon can only be five or fewer levels above you, and you had to have had in\
your possession at least one combination of demons that'll allow you to fuse\
that fusion. (Doesn't mean you had to have owned those two demons at the same\
time, though.)\
\
But, you say, if you have access to the auctions, why fuse? Several reasons for\
that:\
 - There are certain types of demons that will never appear in the auctions - \
   Megami, Divine, Deity, Vile, Tyrant. Naturally, they have some of the best\
   racial skills, too.\
 - Fused demons can inherit their parents' skills. They cannot inherit grayed-\
   out skills, however. And new to this SMT version, you can choose which\
   skills will be inherited, which saves so much reloading time, honestly.\
 - For several races, their highest-tier demons cannot be found in the auction.\
 - Unique demons (ones you can only have one copy of at one time) can only be\
   fused (and are rarely seen as enemies, too).\
 - If your demons have leveled up a bit and have nice stat boosts, resulting\
   fused demons can get stat bonuses too. (More to come on the specifics\
   later.)\
\
So, the moral of the story is: fuse and be happy. Etc, etc.\

\
There are four ways for a demon to get extra stat points:\
 - You buy a 4- or 5-star demon at the auction.\
 - The demon levels up.\
 - You fuse the demon with a Mitama.\
 - You fuse two demons already possessing bonus stat points, and their\
   resulting demon will also gain bonus stats.\
\
Note that there is a limit to the amount of stat boosts a demon can get via\
Mitamas/fusion bonus, which goes up as the demon's (current) level goes up. The\
stats you gain via level up don't affect this limit.\
\
If you surpass the limit, when you next try to fuse that demon with a Mitama,\
that stat will increase by 3, but other stats will decrease by 1-3 points, to\
offset the limit. Also, when fusing two demons who've gained a lot of bonus\
points via Mitamas or leveling up or whatever, the new demon they'll fuse into\
will have a bonus limit that'll cap the possible stat increase this new demon\
will get.\
\
\
\{ // D. Mitama Strategy ..................\
                                   ................................ [2505]\} //\}\
\
Mitamas are fairly useless on their own, but you can fuse them with other\
demons to up that demon's stats (it'll keep all EXP and skills, etc).\
\
When you have enough money to try this (usually on NG+), here's a trick to make\
souped-up Mitamas that'll not only increase the one stat by 3 points, but will\
also increase other stats by a lot as well.\
\
Four demons in the auction come with Watchful - Garm (Fallen), Heimdall\
(Genma), Ym (Dragon), Nekomata (Beast), and Lorelei (Fairy). Fuse them into\
elements:\
\
 - Fallen --> Erthys\
 - Genma, Fairy --> Aeros\
 - Dragon, Beast --> Flaemis\
\
So, Lorelei and Nekomata (or the other way around, whichever) are pretty\
redundant. And to get Aquans, fuse Garm with something like Makara, which'll\
get you a Megami.\
\
You can let these Elements sit around for a while, gaining EXP with Watchful\
while you keep doing your thing. Whenever you feel like it, you can fuse them\
into whatever Mitamas you want. And, especially if you're on the Last Day, they\
can sit around for a while too. They'll level up and get nice stat boosts. When\
you eventually fuse them with your demons, the stat gains will be incredible.\
\
Of course, note that there is a stat bonus cap (for stats you get from fusion),\
so eventually this won't be very useful. But for a while, especially if you\
have demons that never got high stat gains from fusion, this'll help.\
\
You can also use the souped-up Elements to make a demon of one type into a\
higher-level demon of that type, especially if you keep coming across one demon\
that gets commonly used in the best fusions at the end. E.g. Aniel (Divine) +\
Flaemis = Kazfiel, which I ended up fusing maybe...a million of, I dunno.\
\
Also, if magnetite just isn't cutting it for you and you need to graft Holy\
Dance onto a few demons, Ym --> Flaemis --> Mitama with Holy Dance and awesome\
stats.\

\
So very tentative, for now. I honestly don't know if people really need this - \
most of the "best demons" (endgame, at least) are pretty much agreed upon. I\
might just do a quick thing on some good skill sets. Drop me a line with your\
thoughts?\
\
Various skill set ideas:\
\
__ Jump + ___ Rise\
\
 - These do stack. So the damage done will be 1.5 x 1.2. If you need that extra\
   bit of power to wipe out your enemies in one blow or you're going against,\
   say, Belial and you need to do a ton of ice damage, this'll work.\
\
Magic Yin + Mana Aid/Victory Cry (+ ___ Jump/Rise)\
\
 - The damage you do with this combination will be extreme - 1.5 x 1.5/1.2. For\
   longer battles you'll definitely want that team's members to have some kind\
   of mana recovery ability, otherwise you'll be sucked dry pretty quickly. If\
   you can afford it, stacking Jump and Rise will give you even more power.\
\
Magic Yang + a team with Holy Dance/Megidolaon + Blood Wine/Tyranny\
(+ Drain, + Awakening)\
\
 - Even if this team's MP gets drained, why does it matter? You'll be able to\
   recover eventually anyway. Awakening'll give you Magic Yin without the large\
   MP cost, if you choose to use it. If you're in for a long battle somewhere,\
   this kind of setup will definitely keep you going for a long time. Magic\
   Yang probably won't hurt you then, either, as you usually can't drain all\
   the MP of those bosses anyway (and they benefit from Magic Yang as well).\
\
\
Deathbound/Hassohappa + Phys Jump/Rise + Pierce + Phys Repel (OR + Life Aid/\
Life Lift, OR Attack All)\
\
 - For any physical fighter, you'll want Pierce and Phys Jump. Don't use\
   something like Life Surge if you're using moves like Deathbound - Life Aid\
   and Lift will replenish your HP and keep it high, which is what you want for\
   HP-dependant damage-type attacks.\
 - I prefer Phys Reflect to Aid/Lift, though, because if you run into a team\
   with Tetrakarn or Phys Repel, it'll keep it from turning into a messy,\
   deadly situation (your Pierce will reflect back on yourself if you're using\
   something like Phys Drain, too).\
 - I also prefer leaving Attack All off my phys attacker, since you need those\
   passive slots for other things, and it's easier to just have them Deathbound\
   and then get healed afterwards.\
\
Rage Soul + Attack All + Phys Jump/Rise + Pierce + Phys Reflect\
\
 - Pretty insane phys. attack damage here - 2 x 1.5/1.2. The problem with this\
   setup is that you're limited to attacking only. If you're against a team\
   with Phys Repel - aka Rangdas and Murmurs, or the last Lucifer form, you're\
   beyond screwed.\
\
Full Might + Attack All/Deathbound/Hassohappa + Phys Jump/Rise + Pierce + Phys\
Repel\
\
 - I like Full Might a lot more. One, it offers more flexibility - if you don't\
   want to attack, you won't have to. The other thing is, though it doesn't\
   give you x2 attack, it gives you criticals - which will give you Extra Turns\
   and eliminate your enemies' ETs, potentially giving you the chance to do\
   a bit more damage than Rage Soul would, especially in boss fights.\

|29. Events and Route Outlines                                          [2901]|\
=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=\
\
In general, an event with the corresponding person will advance their route.\
Sometimes, another character's event will affect certain routes or your getting\
another character on your team, however. And sometimes, one of the 6/7 route\
characters' events are mandatory for the main plot.\
\
I've tried to give a brief overview of each non-route character's events and\
what role they play. Most of them either 1) do nothing, 2) have a few events\
that are mandatory but otherwise do nothing, or 3) unlock a character for use\
on the Final Day. Note that even though some of these "do nothing," they'll\
still give you interesting story bits, especially about individual characters\
who otherwise don't get an opportunity to appear in the main plot much. But for\
route completion's sake...yeah, they can be ignored.\
\
\
Haru should be bundled with Gin as theirs is a joint route of sorts, but all of\
her events either go towards their route or the main plot anyway.\
\
   NOTE: If you want to get any route other than Yuzu's, you -have- to\
         save Haru on the 4th Day at 17:00. Otherwise, you can't fight\
         the second Bel battle, etc etc. (At least, I'm fairly sure about\
         this one, let me know if it turned out differently for you.)\
\
Honda...really doesn't seem to affect any route, after his mandatory event on\
the 2nd day or so. So, ignore him. Same for the joint events he appears in.\
\
Izuna has almost all plot-mandatory events.\
\
Keisuke's events mostly are mandatory for the plot (namely battles and all of\
the 5th Day craziness). There are a couple that you don't need, though.\
\
Mari's events mostly determine whether or not you can use her as a fighter on\
the Last Day (unless you take Yuzu's route, in which case she can't be used).\
\
Midori has several events that contribute to getting Black Frost as a fighter\
 - the only demon fighter you can have. Basically, make sure to choose her\
optional battle on the 3rd Day, and her event that comes afterwards.\
\
Shoji tends to disseminate information that plays a key role in the plot and\
Atsuro's and Amane's routes, but save a few events in the early days, hers\
aren't necessary.\
\
???/flashy gigolo guy affects Naoya's route the most. Most of his events are\
pretty much mandatory for the main plot anyway, though.\
\
There are several blue events titled "Mysterious man" or "Mysterious woman."\
These pretty much comprise strange individuals talking about humanity and\
demons, and sort of contribute points to getting Naoya's or Amane's routes.\
\
   NOTE: Specific answers to various dialogue questions -do- matter. Not\
         all of them, obviously, but some of them very specifically affect\
         things. I haven't hacked the game so I'm not 100% about this, but\
         the game probably tallies up points depending on how you answered\
         questions and what attitudes you've expressed.\
\
         Either way, it's doubtlessly a good idea not to sound wimpy and\
         always go, "Wah I want to get out of the lockout" / "It's useless\
         we're all going to die" / "Let's just run away" / etc etc. That's\
         no way to be a good video game hero...and the wimping out option's\
         already available by default, anyway (escaping the lockout,\
         Yuzu's route).\
\
\
Below are brief notes on each of the routes. The event flowcharts below contain\
mostly all the events that pertain to the character. This includes battles and\
the mandatory ones.\
\
   NOTE: For all routes, on the 6th Day at 12:00, events with that route's\
         character will appear if you have completed their sequences and\
         unlocked their route. Picking this event will secure their route.\
         The exceptions are Yuzu's, as it's a default, and Gin's, whose\
         battle with Azuma appears at 12:00 but whose route confirmation\
         event shows up at 13:00 or so.\
\
         Note that if you tallied up a bunch of answers in dialogue and\
         email that really go against the route (i.e. being too holy for\
         Naoya, being too demonic for Amane...I jest, mostly), getting\
         the event won't get you the route. So, in a sense, the events\
         which 'secure' the routes really mean you've just come to the\
         end of the chain of events that route has to offer.\
\
\
Flowchart Key:\
 *  - Event cannot be skipped.\
      (Note that all [BATTLE]s by their nature are plot-oriented and cannot be\
       skipped, unless [OPTIONAL] is indicated.)\
\
\
\{// A: Amane ............................\
                                  .................................. [2902] //\}\
\
Most of Amane's route coincides with the main plot, and you probably won't have\
to try to get hers unlocked.\
\
 - When making dialogue choices, just make sure you're at least open-minded to\
   the idea of God and whatnot. Don't ridicule Him/Amane, don't doubt\
   everything they say, etc. Being gung-ho about becoming the Messiah and/or\
   God will also work (though you might shut off, say, Naoya's route).\
\
 1. Throughout the game, several blue events that don't take up time appear,\
    once per day for the middle stretch of the game or so. Some of these\
    contribute to being able to get her route.\
 2. On the 4th day, save Haru at 17:00 by choosing her event. Good idea to have\
    Yuzu remind you what time it is (she'll offer to do so at the beginning of\
    the day).\
 3. Contrary to what some people fear, in the 6th Day battle where you choose\
    to help the angels, the demons, or kill both, choosing to kill the angels\
    will not ruin your chances of getting this route.\
 4. If, on the 6th Day, you get an event with Amane wherein Remiel speaks\
    through her and Strongly Advocates your becoming the Messiah and getting\
    everyone to obey God's teachings through your proselytizing, etc etc,\
    you've secured Amane's route.\

\
One of the possible 5th Day deaths does affect Atsuro's route. Only on Atsuro's\
route do you get information about the EMT field (aka what the government's\
final option is that'll kill everyone on the Last Day).\
\
 - With your dialogue choices, agree with Atsuro whenever possible, and also\
   agree with the idea that keeping demons around could help society.\
\
 1. There are three Atsuro events on the 3rd and 4th Days which should let\
    you find his friend 10Bit and have Atsuro look into the COMP he leaves\
    behind for info on the EMT field.\
 2. On the 4th day, save Haru at 17:00 by choosing her event. Good idea to have\
    Yuzu remind you what time it is (she'll offer to do so at the beginning of\
    the day).\
 3. Keisuke can't die. So on Day 4, make sure you get Mari's bag, and give\
    it to Kaido. Then fight Mari's battle at 12:00, and Keisuke's at 13:00. If\
    you don't give the bag to Kaido, you'll have to choose between Mari's and\
    Keisuke's battles, essentially killing Mari, so there you go.\
 4. On the 6th Day, you'll get one last scene with Atsuro where he talks about\
    the possibility of controlling all the demons. Pick it and agree with him\
    to secure his route.\

\{// C: Gin ..............................\

\
There are a few critical points you have to get through if you want Gin/Haru's\
route.\
\
 - with your dialogue choices, just keep open-minded and don't swing too much\
   towards, say, being the Messiah or the overlord. Agree with Gin when he says\
   he'd like Tokyo to go back to the way it was.\
\
 1. On the 4th day (provided you've been following Gin's events), there'll be\
    an event with him at Shiba Park. Eventually you'll come across two choices\
    in the dialogue when he talks about Aya's disappearance: "Want me to help?"\
    and "Don't give up." Pick the FIRST one. Or else - you guessed it - the\
    route's sealed off, as you won't be able to investigate her disappearance\
    and trigger a key battle on Day 6.\
 2. On the 4th day, save Haru at 17:00 by choosing her event. Good idea to have\
    Yuzu remind you what time it is (she'll offer to do so at the beginning of\
    the day).\
 3. Fight the battle against Azuma on the 6th day, and keep Gin alive. Then\
    view one more scene with him, and the scene with Gin and Amane. When Gin\
    says he'll help you look for Haru and talks about getting rid of all the\
    demons, tell him you agree and will help, and you've secured his route.\
\
The first one could take you by surprise. I kept wondering why I hadn't\
unlocked his route on my first playthrough, only to discover that -that- was\
the reason. Needless to say, wasn't impressed.\

Neither of the 5th Day possible deaths have any effect on getting Kaido's\
route. This route essentially takes the same path as Naoya's and doesn't unlock\
you Kaido's pic on the title screen (it unlocks Naoya's, actually), but it's a\
route nonetheless. Kaido doesn't harp on the Bels and wants power instead,\
though.\
\
If you've unlocked both Kaido's and Naoya's routes, and you choose one of them\
and then decide you need more time to make up your mind, the one you didn't\
select will disappear from the map.\

 3. If you get the option to BS the fight with Keisuke, don't. If you do,\
    you'll have to fight Kaido and Midori in the future, and you'll end up\
    destroying his COMP.\
 4. No matter how the events of the 5th Day went, talk to Kaido. The dialogue\
    will change depending, but he'll ask you if you want to team up with him\
    and get your hands on all the COMPs, putting all the power in your hands.\
    On the 6th Day, agree to help him find the COMP factory, find it (blue\

\
Naoya doesn't seem to be a particularly picky guy. Most of his route's stuff\
coincides with the main plot, and he's pretty keen on you becoming the King\
no matter how reluctant you might sound.\
\
If you've unlocked both Kaido's and Naoya's routes, and you choose one of them\
and then decide you need more time to make up your mind, the one you didn't\
select will disappear from the map.\
\
 - With your dialogue choices, as long as you aren't insanely enthusiastic\
   about being a Messiah, you should be fine, even if you doubt Naoya a little\
   (if you go for power and overlord-ism-ness too much, you'll probably block\
   off other routes).\
\
 1. There are several blue events that don't use up time. You get one per day\
    for three or so days, and some of these contribute to getting Naoya's\
    route.\
 2. On the 4th day, save Haru at 17:00 by choosing her event. Good idea to have\
    Yuzu remind you what time it is (she'll offer to do so at the beginning of\
    the day).\
 3. On the 5th Day, there'll be a mandatory battle where Naoya summons seven\
    demons and stands as an outside party on the field. It's not in the mission\
    requirements, but he wants you to defeat six of them in three turns or less\
    if you want to get info from him. Despite the hype about having to beat\
    them in one turn, two's honestly enough and easily doable even on your\
    first playthrough. Either one's "passing" to him.\
 4. On the 6th Day, there should be an event with Naoya where he says he'd\
    really, really like you to become the King of Bel. Pick it and you've\
    secured Naoya's route.\

events, but they're not mandatory. Just some extra character story stuff. I'm\

Didn't take a certain route but you want to know what happened? Look no\
further. Well...if I got to that route yet, at least. Note that when I\
"summarize," I fall just a little under what'd be pure transcription...yeah.\
So. There's your fair warning.\
\
I'm also trying to keep as objective a voice as possible, but in some of them\
my more...wry comments will probably pepper the whole thing (re: Amane's). Hey,\
I try.\
\
\
\{// A: Amane ............................\
                                  .................................. [3002] //\}\
\
So, you decide to become the Messiah. Cue fanfare. Remiel blames demons for\
corrupting man; though, if mankind was strong, it wouldn't be a problem...but\
the angels don't wish that much from mankind. Angels and demons have fought\
forever, but with the Throne of Bel, you can subdue the demons. He leaves.\
Midori says what he said sounded a lot like what Keisuke said...is this the\
right decision?\
\
Remiel will now lead you all as His messenger. Plus, you don't have to worry\
about the deadline any more, and you can trust his word as the angels won't\
deceive you. Anyway, your task is to defeat all the Bels, starting with\
Jezebel, who's within Amane. Remiel says you've begun to awaken as Abel, which\
will help you.\
\
For this fight, you'll be going into Amane's mind. First, Remiel tells you\
about Abel, His beloved child. You're capable of becoming the Messiah and the\
overlord, yet you're no one special. Remiel says this is true. There once were\
two brothers, Cain and Abel. This was the first human tragedy, as Abel, the\
child of sorrow, was the first human killed by his fellow man \'96 his own\
brother. Abel, killed before awakening as His child, continues to be\
reincarnated as a human, and his essence has been inherited by many.\
Essentially, one Cain, but many Abels. So someone like you isn't rare. But,\
you've defeated two Bels, and Abel's dormant power has begun to awaken within\
you, which was what allowed you to absord the Bels' power in the first place.\
\
But anyway, with the COMP to direct the flow of thoughts, you'll enter Amane's\
soul and fight Jezebel. If you die there, it's like dying in the real world.\
It's also possible that Amane's soul will oppose you, considering how much\
control Jezebel has right now.\
\
You get warped into a "Cartesian Garden." A...beautiful field of flowers and a\
crystal clear pond and so on. (We get the symbolism, really.)  You spot Amane,\
but a voice asks, "Who dares to track mud through another's soul?" Oops, looks\
like it's Jezebel. Suddenly everything goes dark, and the once-utopian garden\
has now become red flaming rock and a lava pond. Charming. Jezebel appears.\
\
After you defeat her, you return to the real world. Atsuro asks Remiel what's\
next, and Amane laughs, saying, "Can't you tell? It's me, Amane." Apparently\
after Jezebel's defeat, Remiel's now gone. But Amane can still hear his voice\
and tell you what to do. She says that yes, they'll be going against the\
Shomonkai's teachings, but in speaking with Remiel, she came to know God's love\
and kindness. The Shomonkai's way causes suffering and uses demonic power,\
which she can't accept, even if it'll put her at odds with her father.\
\
Remiel says your ultimate objective is the King's Gate, or Babel. As the King\
of Bel, you'll lead mankind to peace as God's messenger. The summoning server\
is none other than Babel itself, which Belberith has moved to the demon world.\
However, you'll need to manifest Babel in your world.\
\
The demon world and human world are adjacent to each other, and only a wall of\
power stands between them. Tokyo has been protected by the Four Devas until\
now, and they maintain this wall of power and kept demons from entering before.\
For the Shomonkai to have used COMPs in Tokyo, Amane defeated one of the Devas\
with Jezebel \'96 Jikoku. At that time, she thought her father's teachings were\
the only way to save the world.\
\
Even if you become qualified right now, you can't summon Babel into this world.\
So...you'll have to defeat the remaining Devas, too. Keisuke chimes in, asking\
if it's dangerous to defeat the Devas, since demons could just pour into Tokyo.\
Amane says so many demons have been summoned that it'll be only days before\
this imbalance crushes the human world. Basically, you don't have a choice.\
\
You're off to Eikokuji, a temple near Ikebukuro. Amane also joins your party.\
\
Atsuro says if only he knew this would happen, he'd have paid more attention\
on school trips about these Devas. The group talks about the Devas and Japanese\
history for a bit more, and then you run into Bishamon. He tells you to show\
his power, as he'll let no weakling pass. After that, it's up to you.\
\
After you defeat Bishamon, some sort of dark purple spiral appears in the sky.\
"Tokyo's corruption begins in earnest," Amane says. The next Deva's to the\
south in Sengakuji, in Shinagawa.\
\
The team has an ominous feeling (hint, hint). And yeah \'96 in the next fight, you\
get to fight both remaining Devas, Zouchou and Koumoku, at the same time.\
Atsuro says if the worlds don't connect now, they're going to regret this\
forever. But after you defeat them, the sky resembles molten lava, and there's\
a hole in it. The portal has been opened. If you wait too long, the demon world\
will swallow yours, so you need to hurry. The aperture to the demon world is on\
the top floor of the Hills building, where the Shomonkai's server room is.\
\
Once you get to the building, a humongous fly \'96 Belzaboul \'96 stands in your way.\
Amane says his power might even rival Belberith's. He says he'll take your\
power as an offering to Belberith. When asked why, when he's a Bel himself, he\
says that unfortunately it's not his master's wish, and Belzaboul's mission is\
to get Belberith to the throne.\
\
After you win, Yuzu wonders why the Shomonkai came to worship Belberith in the\
first place. Amane says her father foresaw the coming of God's ordeal while he\
was a student in theological school, and then tells the story of the Tower of\
Babel: long ago, humans tried to build a tall tower that would reach the\
heavens. But this was in defiance of God, who soon showed his wrath. The old\
common language was divided, preventing humans from communicating. But\
technology allowed humans to overcome this, who are now "more than capable of\
repeating such blasphemies." At that time, one king led all the people. If he\
did evil, the rest of humanity would as well without even knowing it.\
\
The act of delivering an individual will was once only available to kings, but\
in today's day and age, anyone can do so. The reverse is also true \'96 people can\
get any information, even fake or malicious info. And knowledge of things such\
as bomb-making, stealing, killing... Amane says that not all humans can\
determine right from wrong, and as more people become involved in virtual\
lives, they become more secluded and run towards comforting lies. If mankind\
continues like this, God will surely judge for us, but mankind might not be\
strong enough to withstand the ordeal. The Shomonkai founder grew afraid of\
this, and wanted to do something about it.\
\
So, he turned to Belberith, the largest of the demons that inherited Bel's\
power. It really wants revenge against God, hence its role in the war.\
\
In the meantime, up the building you go. Yuzu remembers the elevators don't\
work right now and freaks out. Midori cheers her on, and Keisuke comments that\
53 floors must feel practically infinite if you're on foot. Everyone else in\
your party says a little "We're going to make it, MC!" type of thing.\
\
...And then the stairs kill everyone, the end. (Kidding.)\
\
You get to the top of the Hills and emerge in a strange room with a pipe organ,\
glowing green light, and various hi-tech-ish objects. The Founder stands before\
you and tells Amane, "You fool... Know your place! You are a maiden of the\
Shomonkai!" He can't believe she's betrayed them and has lost all hope in her.\
Amane tells him about Remiel, says that destroying God isn't the only way to\
overcome this ordeal, and that the Shomonkai brought the ordeal upon them. Was\
this what they hoped for? The founder says there's nothing left to say.\
\
He then asks Belberith to descend to this world by consuming his flesh and\
soul, with his only condition being that he then defeats God and brings about a\
world free of His ordeals. Belberith agrees, and a huge, purple mass appears on\
the altar. Amane doesn't believe what happened to her father. Belberith laughs\
at how the founder thought he was giving him power, and says he's starting a\
new world order.\
\
After you defeat the last Bel, Amane mourns her father. Atsuro says that even\
though his methods were wrong, he only wanted to save people and wasn't bad.\
Yuzu says Belberith took advantage of him and it's always the humans getting\
hurt, that the angels and demons aren't fair. Amane gathers up her resolve, and\
tells you to summon Babel by awakening the power of Bel inside you.\
\
Right when you're about to do so, Naoya appears. You disappoint him; he'd never\
have guessed you'd end up serving God. He calls you brother, which confuses\
Atsuro. He's always wondered, who exactly is Naoya? Naoya laughs, saying you're\
his younger brother from a long time ago. He says you guys get a game over.\
Atsuro tells him to try. Naoya mocks him, and Atsuro says that though Naoya got\
you all into this, you're not his pawns.\
\
Naoya asks if you remember: ages ago, he cultivated the Earth, and you tended\
sheep... "Thinking back, that was the start of the favoritism. If our places\
were switched..." After a turn, the flashy gigolo guy appears, observes how you\
brothers are fighting, and asks if he can join in. Naoya tersely calls him\
Loki, and he joins in the battle.\
\
Naoya says he thought about it, and God wanted someone to blindly follow him,\
who was you. If that was it, he wouldn't have killed you. "As the Earth tender,\
I offered God my finest crops. But what god wanted was blood! Blood does not\
run in crops! God asked the impossible of me, knowing I was a farmer!" So he\
killed you, pierced your heart, and offered Him blood. Naoya then says that\
you, Abel, hate him, don't you, and that you want to kill him. Otherwise, you\
never could have earned the right to become King. If you tell him you don't\
hate him, he says he won't acknowledge it; either way he won't let you return\
to God.\
\
After you win, Naoya says the punishment God forced upon him will have you meet\
again. One day, he'll get his revenge. With that, he disappears. You realize\
Naoya must have been Cain. When Abel was killed, his essence was widely\
inherited as seeds for the future, but Cain's punishment was to be forever\
reincarnated while bearing that sin \'96 accumulating memories forever. Atsuro\
says no wonder Naoya could predict people so well \'96 he lived so many lifetimes.\
But supposedly, it's to give Cain time to gain awareness of what he's done.\
Cain claims God doesn't love him and thus killed Abel, but that can't be true,\
otherwise God wouldn't have given him this time to reflect. And the\
accumulation of memories is God's love. Supposedly. But unfortunately, Cain\
used the time to plan revenge, as he sought to have Abel lead demons against\
God.\
\
As for Loki, he's a trickster god of Norse mythology. As a half-god,\
half-giant, he'd deceive or help whoever he pleased. You can now fuse him in\
the Cathedral of Shadows. But anyway, back to the summoning. All of your party\
members each say one more line of encouragement or camaraderie.\
\
The MC glows, and suddenly a huge, golden tower shoots down from the sky and\
crashes into the Hills building. A large gray head of a young woman with short\
hair appears. And after you defeat the first Babel form, all the Bels reappear.\
Then comes the final form of Babel.\
\
After you get through that, the tower of Babel crashes down. According to\
Amane, Remiel says the lockdown will be lifted and peace returned. And, as\
Atsuro points out, you're now an overlord...er, Messiah. Yuzu says you're not\
human any more, but apologizes and says she had no right to say that. Both of\
them comment on your strength and how they never could have borne such a\
burden. And now a world of order without chaos will begin.\
\
There's an announcement about the lockdown ending. Kaido says it looks like\
it's back to dullsville. Haru says you guys really did it. As does Izuna, who\
says frankly that no mission has ever been this painful for her. Fushimi says\
that after these seven days of panic and confinement, they have to handle this\
carefully; their job's just begun. Izuna says it doesn't involve demons, so\
sign her up as his first volunteer.\
\
[Soon afterward, the Tokyo lockdown that lasted seven days was finally lifted.\
\
Though only a few knew the truth, people could sense that the malicious\
presences had disappeared. Those who survived were grateful to be alive, and\
mourned for those were less fortunate. A new form of order came over this world\
that had regained peace.\
\
The young new King of Bel, who held the power of demons, was urged to use that\
power as God's advocate: to be the absolute judge of man's sins. Thus would man\
always live with the fear of God and live pure lives at all times.\
\
A new age of law had come to the world.]\
\
(The above is said over an image of the MC in a spiffy (perhaps?) white cape-\
robe-garment, Amane, Yuzu, and Atsuro. Yeah, can't quite get over the cape, for\
better or worse.)\
\
[Some time after the incident, you receive an email on your altered COMP, whose\
role in the events has already ended...]\
\
From M:\

    before the Lord, this world shall be filled with His authority as a\
    place of order. All lies, doubts, and disloyalty shall be judged\
    accordingly.\
\
    I shall be watching you in your capacity as His loyal servant..."\

\
Atsuro wants you to hear him out. He says that there's definitely a way to\
control all the demons through the server, and if you choose not to annihilate\
them and keep them around, it could help mankind. Access to them would be\
restricted to special government organizations, but he likens it with nuclear\
energy in the hands of the government \'96 it allows the citizenry to benefit,\
without the danger, if done properly. He says that this would require\
significant reprogramming of the server, which he can't do on his own...you'll\
have to find Naoya and convince him to join you. If you fulfilled the\
requirements, Mari will also join you.\
\
The next day, you'll find Naoya, who's also looking for you. He says the\
deadline's been moved up to 13:00 and it's now or never for you to become the\
King of Bel. You tell him that you want to go through with Atsuro's plan.\
Naoya that if you become the King, you'll be able to control the demons. Atsuro\
says that's not the same thing, as it'd be power in the hands of one person.\
Right or wrong, a dictator's a dictator. Naoya says its meaningless, pointing\
to what he calls their corrupt country as an example. He says he'll tell you\
where the server is, but Atsuro says you need his help as well. He laughs,\
saying this dependency makes your plan flawed, but you tell him he's no\
different, needing you. He says his situation's quite different, but decides to\
play a game with you: defeat him, and he'll help.\
\
After the battle, Naoya looks absolutely livid, and can't believe you've gotten\
so strong, saying that must be the power of Bel. But a promise is a promise,\
and he'll help you change the server's programming. After all, he'll just have\
to wait 1000 years for what he wants, he says...he just wanted to see your\
power and potential for himself. Sariel shows up (via a possessed human) to\
keep an eye on Naoya. Naoya says he'll be at his apartment in Aoyama, with a\
backup generator and the files he needs, and tells you to find him in a few\
hours.\
\
Atsuro says you need to get the deadline pushed back, so you're off to find\
Izuna and Fushimi. Atsuro tells them your plan, saying that if you can control\
all the demons by 13:00, they should stop the final option. You also tell them\
you have the angels' approval...and you want more time. Fushimi asks what kind\
of a limb you're pushing him out on, but says he'll try. Atsuro says that when\
you succeed, you'll send all the demons back to their world, and that'll be the\
sign that it worked. Fushimi then tells Izuna to join your party and help.\
\
Off to ask Remiel where the server is. He confirms that the server's becoming\
Babel, and says it's because Belberith took the server to the demon world in\
order to "use it as a medium for Babel" \'96 he wants the power, and since Babel\
can't be seen or touched, this was the only way to interact with it. But, since\
Belberith's still fighting over the throne of Bel, it means he can't be King\
quite yet. So, you'll have to make yourself qualified before Belberith does so.\
You won't have to go into the demon world; Babel is the King's Gate, and the\
final trial, so it'll show itself once you're qualified. As Remiel says,\
"Connect the two worlds by eliminating the power that divides them." (Which\
he'll explain later.) Then you can open a portal through which you'll summon\
Babel.\
\
You'll have to gain power from the other Bels, through either ritual or combat.\
Jezebel no longer resides in Amane, however, and her presence seems to have\
vanished from this world. Whether she was afraid of you and ran, or whether she\
was defeated by a Bel, Remiel doesn't know. But he thinks Belberith killed her,\
because he'd rather have her power than let you get it. And if he becomes\
qualified, Babel will be summoned into the demon world where you can't go.\
\
The demon world and human world are adjacent to each other, and only a wall of\
power stands between them. Tokyo has been protected by the Four Devas until\
now, and they maintain this wall of power and kept demons from entering before.\
For the Shomonkai to have used COMPs in Tokyo, they had to have defeated one of\
the Devas \'96 Jikoku. Remiel says though Amane was distressed by it, she had her\
reasons for helping in its defeat. Atsuro says this part with the Devas makes\
more sense, as if the demon summoning program just recreated rituals, normal\
rituals to summon also should've worked.\
\
Remiel also adds that even if you become qualified right now, you can't summon\
Babel into this world. So...you'll have to defeat the remaining Devas, too.\
Midori chimes in, asking if it's dangerous to defeat the Devas, since demons\
could just pour into Tokyo. Remiel says this is true, and what awaits humans\
then is certain destruction. But so many demons have been summoned that it'll\
be only days before this imbalance crushes the human world. Basically, you\
don't have a choice.\
\
Remiel says one Deva is to the north, the fiercest one, at a temple near\
Ikebukuro. Atsuro exclaims that going for the strongest one first isn't the\
normal order of things. But Eikokuji it is, and on you go.\
\
Atsuro says if only he knew this would happen, he'd have paid more attention\
on school trips about these Devas. The group talks about the Devas and Japanese\
history for a bit more, and then you run into Bishamon. He tells you to show\
his power, as he'll let no weakling pass. After that, it's up to you.\
\
After you defeat Bishamon, some sort of dark purple spiral appears in the sky.\
Your group knows this was due to his defeat. Remiel appears, saying good job\
and that the next Deva's to the south in another temple, in Shinagawa. Yuzu\
thinks it's Sengakuji. Remiel warns you not to be hasty and to prepare.\
\
The team has an ominous feeling (hint, hint). And yeah \'96 in the next fight, you\
get to fight both remaining Devas, Zouchou and Koumoku, at the same time. When\
you defeat them, the sky resembles molten lava, and there's a hole in it. The\
portal has been opened.\
\
Your group heads over to Naoya's to see how things are going. The Shomonkai are\
guarding it, like Remiel said. Naoya says you're stronger than he thought if\
you progressed this quickly already. When you ask about the program, he says\
not to rush things, as you still have to defeat the Bels. He tells you\
Belberith is at the top of the Hills building, which is also where you can\
summon Babel. That's also where the Shomonkai lab is, and where the server\
used to be.\
\
Pretty much, Naoya needs a little more time, as he has to revamp the interface\
and security. Atsuro groans, saying he completely forgot about how hackers\
would want to crack a system like this. Naoya sighs and says he really is\
dense. Atsuro's about to ask something else, but Naoya says that if Atsuro's\
his right-hand apprentice, he should just do what needs doing himself. Being\
called that fires Atsuro up.\
\
Naoya says this will give mankind great power, but again, great power and great\
risks go hand in hand. He'll wait to see if mankind can really use it to the\
fullest, and laughs.\
\
Once you get to the building, a humongous fly \'96 Belzaboul \'96 stands in your way.\
He says he'll take your power as an offering to Belberith. When asked why, when\
he's a Bel himself, he says that unfortunately it's not his master's wish, and\
Belzaboul's mission is to get Belberith to the throne.\
\
After you win, Yuzu wonders why the Shomonkai came to worship Belberith in the\
first place. Fushimi appears, saying their dossiers might help. But first, he\
says that the government decided to give them an hour's grace before the final\
option, and if the plan works, the final option will be canceled.\
\
Fushimi then tells the story of the Tower of Babel: long ago, humans tried to\
build a tall tower that would reach the heavens. But this was in defiance of\
God, who soon showed his wrath. The old common language was divided, preventing\
humans from communicating. The Shomonkai founder believed that tragedy would\
happen again soon, and wanted to do something about it. The first demon that he\
managed to summon was Belberith, the largest of the demons that inherited Bel's\
power. It really wants revenge against God, hence its role in the war.\
\
In the meantime, up the building you go. Yuzu remembers the elevators don't\
work right now and freaks out. Midori cheers her on, and Keisuke comments that\
53 floors must feel practically infinite if you're on foot.\
\
There's no turning  back at this point; it's the tower or bust. Atsuro wonders\
if Naoya'll make it, but Fushimi shows up and tells you to go ahead and says\
he'll tell Naoya where you are. Atsuro starts to doubt whether he can hack the\
server or not, but reminds himself that he's Naoya's apprentice, and that he\
has to. Everyone else in your party says a little "We're going to make it, MC!"\
type of thing.\
\
...And then the stairs kill everyone, the end. (Kidding.)\
\
You get to the top of the Hills and emerge in a strange room with a pipe organ,\
glowing green light, and various hi-tech-ish objects. The Founder stands before\
you, and says it was disgraceful to allow you to get so far. He asks why you've\
come here, and scoffs at whatever you say, reaffirming his ideals and how he\
believes this is the only way to save mankind from God and create an age of\
reform. He then asks Belberith to descend to this world by consuming his flesh\
and soul, with his only condition being that he then defeats God and brings\
about a world free of His ordeals. Belberith agrees, and a huge, purple mass\
appears on the altar. The other Believers hesitantly cheer his presence.\
\
After you defeat the last Bel, Naoya appears. You're going to summon Babel now.\
All of your party members say one more line of encouragement or camaraderie.\
\
The MC glows, and suddenly a huge, golden tower shoots down from the sky and\
crashes into the Hills building. Naoya says that if you have a change of heart,\
now's the last time. Yuzu tells him you're not going to be King, so leave it\
be; Naoya says he was joking. He heads off to the center console to hack the\
server, and tells you to cover him. Atsuro excitedly asks him what he can do;\
Naoya tells him to put a lid on it, and then to go to the sub-console.\
\
After a bit of fighting, the security system \'96 Babel \'96 appears in the form of a\
big gray head. Defeat it, defeat its true form, and you're done. Naoya tells\
Atsuro to key in the command telling all demons to return to their world.\
\
Cut to a new scene \'96 Fushimi's trying to protect a citizen from rogue demons,\
to no avail, when suddenly they all disappear in little clouds of (what I guess\
are) data packets.\
\
The tower of Babel crashes down. Naoya's rewritten the program, so demons are\
directly controlled without contracts. They have no say in the matter, and\
their power's now yours. Yuzu asks if it's over, and Naoya says in regards to\
the result you were aiming for, yes. He tells you that though you won an\
important victory today, don't forget that even before the demons, the world\
was "no paradise." It's all up to humans now. You can tell him you believe in\
humanity, yourself, or the future; either way, it's just the kind of answer he\
expects.\
\
Fushimi radioes in to his superiors, who reply that they're lifting the\
lockdown. Shoji observes the demons disappearing and says you kids really did\
it. Kaido says he's not imagining things, and that it's over. Remiel, via\
Amane, says that you've overcome this ordeal, but don't forget that if man\
loses his way again, there'll yet be more ordeals. He says, "I...want to\
believe in man," and prays for a peaceful future, for mankind, not just for\
order. Gin says it's over, and also says Aya's name. The flashy gigolo guy\
chuckles at how you chose to use technology instead of becoming king, and says\
he never tires of seeing "what they'll come up with next." But still, with\
great power comes temptation, so he'll look forward to seeing what you do in\
the next few years.\
\
[And so, Babel and the demons came under man's control.\
\
Few knew the truth, but the disappearance of the demons led to an unspoken\
understanding that the situation had come to a close.\
\
That evening, the Tokyo lockdown that lasted seven days was finally lifted.\
Those who survived were grateful to be alive, and eventually they turned to\
moruning the victims. The government announced that the incident was a mass\
hallucination caused by gas leaks. Those who claimed to have seen demons were\
unable to prove it.\
\
The program had been rewritten, and COMPs could no longer summon demons. With\
technology harnessing demons' power, the world headed toward a third revolution\
on par with the industrial and informational revolutions.\
\
This drastic change in the balance of power caused a shift in Japan's fortunes.\
The military use of demons pushed Japan to an international role as a permanent\
UN Security Council member. Military might secured their status as an equal\
world power... This was the new Japan.]\
\
Cutscene - Yuzu, Atsuro, and you, with a COMP in hand:\
\
[Some time after the incident, when your memories of it have begun to fade, you\
receive an email on your no-longer-functional COMP...]\
\
From M:\
\
   "Son of man... Rather than become King of Bel, you took dominion over\
    the demons with the skill and knowledge you gained. I have witnessed\
    it with my own eyes. However, if you are consumed with the power of\
    evil and succmb to desire, pandemonium will be again released...and\
    this world will feel His wrath once more.\
\
    I will be watching you, that order rules over man's future..."\
\
Credits roll.\

\{// C: Gin ..............................\
                                  .................................. [3004] //\}\
\
Gin tells you he wants to erase all demons from Tokyo and restore the city to\
what it was, and asks you to lend him strength. He then joins your party and\
begins to go over tomorrow\'92s plans \'96 "If a song we need can be created, the\
maiden will show us how to reach the server." Basically, you\'92ll need to find\
Haru and Amane. Mari will join the party if you fulfilled the requirements.\
\
Gin reminds you that the deadline\'92s at 18:00. You suggest going to Bugeikan to\
find Haru. Black Frost also joins your party. Atsuro says it\'92s kinda weird that\
a demon\'92s coming along to help get rid of demons, but...\
\
You find Haru. She says Gin\'92s up early for a night owl; he replies, funny what\
a demon invasion will do for your sleep pattern. She says she needs a few more\
hours, but the song\'92ll be done. Izuna finds you and says the deadline\'92s been\
cut to 13:00 because all the blockades are under heavy attack. She\'92s trying to\
negotiate for more time, and wishes you luck. Yuzu wonders how you\'92re going to\
do this; Haru says she\'92ll keep plugging away at the song. Gin chuckles, and\
says Haru seems like a different girl than who she was yesterday.\
\
You find Amane \'96 or Remiel, rather. Gin tells him that the song will be ready\
before the deadline. Remiel says angels don\'92t lie, and that he will tell you\
how to get to the server, as promised. Gin mentions the new deadline, which\
Remiel says he\'92s aware of. First, you have to meet a number of conditions and\
processes before you can access the server. You need to defeat the remaining\
Bels to become King. The final trial in the fight for the throne is against\
Babel, formed from the amount of energy lost by the original Bel \'96 which is\
the summoning server itself.\
\
Atsuro asks in shock, "The Tower of Babel? From the Book of Genesis?" Remiel\
affirms it, and says only the King can summon and awaken Babel. It was once in\
this world, but Belberith tricked the Shomonkai into moving it to the demon\
world, to use the server as a medium through which to manifest Babel. The\
server harnesses the flow of thoughts, and the user can bend it to his will \'96\
making it good for the task of controlling Babel. However, Belberith\'92s still\
fighting for the throne, proving that he\'92s not yet worthy of becoming King. The\
final objective in the war is to gain the power sleeping in Babel. So, you\'92ll\
have to defeat all the Bels to get that. Speaking of which, there\'92s one pretty\
close to you...Jezebel, in Amane. Yuzu says as Remiel\'92s also in her body,\
wouldn\'92t it be easier for him to defeat Jezebel instead? Remiel answers that he\
lends you strength because you attempt to withstand the ordeal with your own\
strength. Jezebel\'92s slowly taking over Amane\'92s soul, and Remiel can\'92t hold it\
off much longer.\
\
But anyway, with the COMP to direct the flow of thoughts, you'll enter Amane's\
soul and fight Jezebel. If you die there, it's like dying in the real world.\
It's also possible that Amane's soul will oppose you, considering how much\
control Jezebel has right now.\
\
You get warped into a "Cartesian Garden." A...beautiful field of flowers and a\
crystal clear pond and so on. (We get the symbolism, really.)  You spot Amane,\
but a voice asks, "Who dares to track mud through another's soul?" Oops, looks\
like it's Jezebel. Suddenly everything goes dark, and the once-utopian garden\
has now become red flaming rock and a lava pond. Charming. Jezebel appears.\
\
After you win, you return to the real world. Amane thanks you. Gin asks how to\
get to the server, and that if she doesn\'92t tell him soon, he\'92ll stop believing\
them. Amane says that Remiel\'92s consciousness just left her body, but a promise\
is a promise. As Belberith has the server, you\'92ll need to manifest Babel in\
your world. The demon world and human world are adjacent to each other, and\
only a wall of power stands between them, which you\'92ll need to remove. They\
didn\'92t tell you until now because it\'92s a heavy gamble that puts the world in\
danger.\
\
You\'92ll have to defeat the Four Devas to corrupt Tokyo, though this began long\
ago. The city has been protected by the Four Devas until now, and they\
maintain this wall of power and kept demons from entering before. For the\
Shomonkai to have used COMPs in Tokyo, Amane defeated one of the Devas with\
Jezebel \'96 Jikoku. At that time, she thought her father\'92s teachings were the\
only way to save the world.\
\
Even if you become qualified right now, you can\'92t summon Babel into this world.\
So...you\'92ll have to defeat the remaining Devas, too. As Atsuro points out, a\
"destroy the city in order to save it" sort of thing. If you fail, demons will\
be able to cross between the worlds at will, which will lead to destruction.\
Amane says that so many demons have been summoned that it\'92ll be only days\
before this imbalance crushes the human world. Basically, you don\'92t have a\
choice.\
\
You\'92re off to Eikokuji, a temple near Ikebukuro. Amane also joins your party.\
\
Atsuro says if only he knew this would happen, he\'92d have paid more attention on\
school trips about these Devas. Gin says that\'92s a good attitude \'96 he should\
remember that after the lockdown\'92s over. The group talks about the Devas and\
Japanese history for a bit more, and then you run into Bishamon. He tells you\
to show his power, as he\'92ll let no weakling pass. After that, it\'92s up to you.\
\
After you defeat Bishamon, some sort of dark purple spiral appears in the sky.\
"Tokyo\'92s corruption begins in earnest," Amane says. The next Deva\'92s to the\
south in Sengakuji, in Shinagawa.\
\
The team has an ominous feeling (hint, hint). And yeah \'96 in the next fight, you\
get to fight both remaining Devas, Zouchou and Koumoku, at the same time. After\
you defeat them, the sky resembles molten lava, and there\'92s a hole in it. The\
portal has been opened.\
\
Remiel says to delete all the demons, you\'92ll need the song of truth. If you\
infuse Babel with it, it should return all demons to their world. In addition\
to becoming King, you\'92ll also have to close Babel \'96 the King\'92s Gate, otherwise\
demons can just come through again. Gin asks how you\'92ll do that, and Amane says\
she doesn\'92t know. It must be the angels\'92 will that humans search for the means\
themselves. Atsuro says they do this every time you need them. Amane says\
they\'92re forbidden from helping humans during an ordeal, but Remiel\'92s at least\
given you information; you should be grateful.\
\
Yuzu says the deadline\'92s fast approaching, and you should think about getting\
some extra insurance. Off to find Izuna and Fushimi. After you tell them\
everything, Fushimi decides to believe that you can get rid of all the demons,\
and says he\'92ll send an order to the SDF to abor the final option. It should\
confuse the higher-ups enough to buy some time. He\'92ll have to deal with the\
consequences afterwards if you all make it, but he\'92s prepared, and just wishes\
he could do more. Atsuro says it\'92s okay, as you can\'92t endanger everything\
outside the lockdown. Fushimi says he thought youw ere just children before,\
but he\'92s honored to know you. He then tells Izuna to join  your party.\
\
Haru\'92s almost done with the song \'96 the track Aya left behind is broken up, and\
when it\'92s put together it\'92ll be fine, but the most important track\'92s missing.\
The file won\'92t open, saying, "Data corrupt." Yuzu tells Atsuro to fix it, and\
he says he doesn\'92t have a charged laptop or power source to work with. Haru\
says Aya was a genius and that no one could possibly mimic what she did. Gin\
says Aya told him that Haru would surely outshine her one day. Haru tells him\
to spare her the comforting lies. Gin asks her why she thinks Aya quit being\
D-Va\'92s vocalist; Haru says, well, she hurt her throat, and...\
\
Gin says Aya told him not to tell, but it\'92s true \'96 it was to make her sing.\
Haru says it\'92s a lie, but Gin silences her, saying Aya left that song in her\
hands, and if she can\'92t do it, who else can? He begs her, saying Aya\'92d have\
wanted it this way. Haru calls him a softie, and says she won\'92t take\
responsibility for what happens, but she\'92ll do it. Oddly, the track sounds like\
the first song Haru ever wrote...she then has a realization. The chord\
progression\'92s from what she wrote when Aya was teaching her. Gin remembers \'96 it\
was a year ago, and Aya was excited, saying she had a gift for songwriting, and\
that if it was arranged well it\'92d be better than her own stuff. This is the\
same song, just with that kind of arrangement. Haru says that Aya was\
amazing...now that she knows what this is, she can remember the missing part.\
Gin asks her about Aya, "Now do you believe it?" Haru cries a little, but says\
that hell yeah, she can finish this. Gin says Aya\'92s alive inside her; she\
doesn\'92t need to look for her any more, just play her own music. Haru says\
enough with the speeches; she has work to do. She\'92ll catch up with you later.\
Amane calls her Harusawa (her full name) and tells her you\'92ll be at the Hills;\
she says to call her Haru \'96 the lead singer of D-Va. Amane laughs, saying the\
song\'92s in good hands.\
\
Once you get to the building, a humongous fly \'96 Belzaboul \'96 stands in your way.\
Amane says his power might even rival Belberith\'92s. He says he\'92ll take your\
power as an offering to Belberith. When asked why, when he\'92s a Bel himself, he\
says that unfortunately it\'92s not his master\'92s wish, and Belzaboul\'92s mission is\
to get Belberith to the throne.\
\
After you win, Belberith\'92s all that\'92s left. Amane notes that he, as well as her\
father, will be determined to defeat you. She\'92s okay with fighting him, though,\
as once Belberith\'92s defeated, she\'92s sure he\'92ll come to his senses. Yuzu wonders\
why the Shomonkai came to worship Belberith in the first place. Amane says her\
father foresaw the coming of God\'92s ordeal while he was a student in theological\
school, and then tells the story of the Tower of Babel: long ago, humans tried\
to build a tall tower that would reach the heavens. But this was in defiance of\
God, who soon showed his wrath. The old common language was divided, preventing\
humans from communicating. But technology allowed humans to overcome this, who\
are now "more than capable of repeating such blasphemies." At that time, one\
king led all the people. If he did evil, the rest of humanity would as well\
without even knowing it.\
\
The act of delivering an individual will was once only available to kings, but\
in today\'92s day and age, anyone can do so. The reverse is also true \'96 people can\
get any information, even fake or malicious info. And knowledge of things such\
as bomb-making, stealing, killing... Amane says that not all humans can\
determine right from wrong, and as more people become involved in virtual\
lives, they become more secluded and run towards comforting lies. If mankind\
continues like this, God will surely judge for us, but mankind might not be\
strong enough to withstand the ordeal. The Shomonkai founder grew afraid of\
this, and wanted to do something about it.\
\
So, he turned to Belberith, the largest of the demons that inherited Bel\'92s\
power. It really wants revenge against God, hence its role in the war.\
\
In the meantime, up the building you go. Yuzu remembers the elevators don\'92t\
work right now and freaks out. Atsuro tells her getting mad at him won\'92t help.\
Gin looks pensive, and Amane says she\'92s sure Haru will make it in time. Gin\
says he knows that. If he doesn\'92t believe in her, who will?\
\
Fushimi appears. He gave the order and the operation\'92s in chaos, but it won\'92t\
last for more than 90 minutes. You have until 14:30.\
\
Once you go up, you can\'92t come back down. Gin worries about Haru. Atsuro says\
you can\'92t wait any longer. Fushimi says he\'92ll tell her when she gets here to\
head up. Gin says there could be demons around, and he can\'92t hold them off.\
Fushimi says it\'92s true he doesn\'92t have the powers you do, but don\'92t\
underestimate his desire to save the city. Gin laughs and says he\'92s another\
idiot just like you guys; doesn\'92t he know heroes are out of fashion? He tells\
him not to die. Fushimi wishes you good luck. Everyone else in your party says\
a little "We\'92re going to make it, MC!" type of thing.\
\
...And then the stairs kill everyone, the end. (Kidding.)\
\
You get to the top of the Hills and emerge in a strange room with a pipe organ,\
glowing green light, and various hi-tech-ish objects. The Founder stands before\
you and tells Amane, "Know your place! You are a maiden of the Shomonkai!" He\
can\'92t believe she\'92s betrayed them and has lost all hope in her. Amane tells him\
about Remiel, says that destroying God isn\'92t the only way to overcome this\
ordeal, and that the Shomonkai brought the ordeal upon them. Was this what they\
hoped for? The founder says she\'92s hopelessly naive. Gin says he\'92s lost it.\
\
He then asks Belberith to descend to this world by consuming his flesh and\
soul, with his only condition being that he then defeats God and brings about a\
world free of His ordeals. Belberith agrees, and a huge, purple mass appears\
on the altar. Amane doesn\'92t believe what happened to her father. Belberith\
laughs at how the founder thought he was giving him power, and says he\'92s\
starting a new world order.\
\
After you defeat the last Bel, Amane mourns her father. Atsuro says that even\
though his methods were wrong, he only wanted to save people and wasn\'92t bad.\
Yuzu says Belberith took advantage of him and it\'92s always the humans getting\
hurt, that the angels and demons aren\'92t fair. Amane gathers up her resolve,\
and tells you to summon Babel by awakening the power of Bel inside you.\
\
After you defeat the last Bel, Haru appears. Though she didn\'92t see the battle,\
she notices Amane\'92s mood, and asks her if she can keep going. She says Amane\
still has life in her eyes, and tells her to keep her chin up. "Cry and scream\
if you want to, but press on without regrets!" She also tells her to stop\
calling her Harusawa. Gin says a woman\'92s emotions really are like a roller\
coaster, and asks about the song. Haru says it\'92s done, but the sequencer\'92s\
batteries are almost out. This\'92ll be a live run without practice. Gin says it\
looks like she\'92s her normal self, and doesn\'92t have anything to worry about.\
\
You\'92re going to summon Babel now. All of your party members each say one more\
line of encouragement or camaraderie. Haru says she thinks Aya gave her work\
because she knew what was going to happen. Gin says regardless of the truth,\
he\'92s thankful for Aya \'96 that he met her, and everything about her. After\
everything\'92s all said and done, he wants Haru to sing. She asks if he has a\
fever or something, since he\'92s always listened to her. Gin laughs, but says he\
wants to hear her again.\
\
The MC glows, and suddenly a huge, golden tower shoots down from the sky and\
crashes into the Hills building. Atsuro says he thought it\'92d be more of a...\
well, a gate, or something different at least. Yuzu says it\'92s like a tower, but\
it\'92s huge. Haru comments on her great audience, and asks if she just has to\
sing the song here. Amane says that\'92s what Remiel told her. If you close the\
gate after the song\'92s uploaded, all the demons will leave and be unable to\
return. Atsuro says he\'92ll take care of uploading it to Babel.\
\
After a bit of fighting, the security system \'96 Babel \'96 appears in the form of a\
big gray head \'96 an old man with long hair. Defeat it, and you\'92re done. \
\
Fushimi\'92s trying to guard a civilian from a horde of demons, when they all\
suddenly disappear. A soldier appears and says all the demons are disappearing\
one by one. Fushimi puts down his gun, and says you made it in time.\
\
Yuzu says all you have to do now is close the gate. Babel shakes and all of\
your party members glow, and Haru says your COMP\'92s demons are going back too.\
Black Frost appears, and says his journey ends here. He said he was happy\
learning about love and that it was fun fighting alongside you. Midori\
realizes that he\'92s going to disappear as well. Black Frost says he\'92ll never,\
ever, ever forget you, and he\'92ll spread love around the demon realm. He thanks\
you and disappears. Midori says someday, after he's taught demons about love,\
they\'92ll be able to hang out again.\
\
The tower starts shaking really badly. Yuzu says Babel\'92s acting funny. The\
tower splits off, and rises back into the sky, before the gold paneling flies\
off and it reveals its true form. It falls back down and splits open; that\'92s\
why it\'92s called the King\'92s Gate. Haru leaves. You get to fight \'96 without any\
demons.\
\
When you win, Babel asks you your wish. You tell it to go back to the demon\
realm. It disappears, and you\'92re back on top of the Hills building. Your party\
cheers. Haru\'92s exhausted. Gin worries, but she asks what\'92s up with his\
expression; Aya\'92d be laughing at him. He says it was her best performance yet.\
Your team leaders all say a little thing each.\
\
Fushimi says the crisis is averted and lifts the lockdown. Shoji says the sky\'92s\
back to the same foul blue, and that you guys really did it. Naoya says he\
didn\'92t predict this \'96 you discarded your own power and made both God and the\
demons withdraw. "Thus does mankind prove its worth." But he says he won\'92t give\
up, with a grin.\
\
[And so, Babel was destroyed.\
\
Though only a few knew the truth, people could sense that the malicious\
presences had disappeared. That evening, the Tokyo lockdown that lasted seven\
days was finally lifted. Those who survived were grateful to be alive, and\
eventually they turned to mourning the victims.\
\
The government announced that the incident was a mass hallucination caused by\
gas leaks. Those who claimed to have seen demons were unable to prove it.\
\
With the demon summoning server gone, the altered COMPs ceased to function.]\
\
(The above is said above a series of background images of Tokyo. The next part\
is said against an image of Yuzu, Atsuro, and you, in the afternoon sun.)\
\
[And then... One day, some time after the incident, you receive an email on\
your COMP, which should have already gone dark...]\
\
From M:\
\
   "Son of man,\
\
    Your decision to relinquish the power of Bel is admirable... But that\
    tremendous power still slumbers within you. Should you succumb to its\
    temptation and use it for your own desire, we shall smite you down.\
\
    Son of man, the fate of your world rests on whether you lose to your\
    lesser nature. Forget it not."\
\
Credits roll.\

\
(For the most part, see Naoya's route below. Basic differences are how the\
route starts - Kaido wants to seize power so that he can protect things\
important to him, and you're about to set off on your COMP factory takeover\
plan when Naoya appears, telling you that there's an easier way: for you to\
become the King of Bel.\
\
 More detailed version to come.)\
\
\
\
\{// E: Naoya ............................\
                                  .................................. [3006] //\}\
\
You see Naoya and Kaido discussing a plan. Naoya greets you and says he\'92s found\
someone with talents, so he\'92s inviting Kaido along. Kaido learns you\'92re cousins\
and says, no wonder you\'92re so weird. Naoya reminds you that if you become the\
overlord you can lift the lockdown, and you\'92ll battle against God. If you\
unlocked Kaido\'92s route, you ask him about his original plan, and he replies\
that his crew\'92s taken hold of the COMP producing factory, but with this plan,\
he doesn\'92t need them. He says that the lockdown\'92s God\'92s fault, and it\'92s pissing\
him off. Naoya says once you become overlord, you can have anything you want...\
well, money\'92ll be useless at that point, he laughs.\
\
You can choose to think about it more, say you want Naoya to help Atsuro if you\
unlocked his route, or go with Naoya\'92s route. When you do, Yuzu, Midori, and\
Keisuke will say they can\'92t agree with what you\'92re doing and/or go with you,\
and leave your party. Atsuro can\'92t believe it. Naoya says to leave them be, and\
that anyone in this world can be replaced easily. You choose your own friends;\
don\'92t waste time and energy fighting them.\
\
Atsuro asks what Naoya\'92s trying to do and what he\'92ll gain from making you a\
demon king. Naoya says isn\'92t Atsuro happy for you, as he\'92s giving you the gift\
of power? At any rate, mankind will benefit; if a man rules over demonkind, the\
demons will serve man and won\'92t harm him. Kaido asks if this will really stop\
the government\'92s final option. Naoya says it\'92ll depend on negotiations, but who\
would be foolish to say no to all the demons? If you ask Naoya what the risks\
are, he says the only one is dealing with God; but, defeating him means mankind\
will be free of His tyranny forever. Of course, Naoya will find a way and help\
you. Atsuro asks if this\'92ll really work out by 18:00 tomorrow, and Naoya calls\
him ever the worrier. He says it\'92ll be fine; he has some things to look into,\
but he\'92ll be back by morning and you should rest; "The last curtain will rise,\
and you will be the next overlord."\
\
Kaido asks who Naoya is. Atsuro tells him he made the summoning system. Kaido\
says his mind\'92s too sharp and he\'92s got a lot of secrets. Atsuro laughs, saying\
everyone says that when they meet him for the first time. Kaido says he doesn\'92t\
seem to be lying, though, so he doesn\'92t see a problem in working with him for\
now. He also tells you that you need to figure out a speech, because declaring\
war on the world should be epic.\
\
In the morning, Atsuro wonders how Yuzu\'92s doing. Kaido calls you Mr. Overlord.\
Naoya appears, saying he has a bit of bad news: the deadline\'92s been cut to\
noon. Still, he says not to panic. Atsuro asks, once again, if your becoming\
the overlord will save everyone. Naoya says who knows, and to ask you.\
\
So, taking out the Bels. The first one lurks within a human...Jezebel, in\
Amane\'92s mind. Meanwhile, Mari shows up, and says it\'92s her turn to let Kaido\
lean on her. Black Frost also joins your party, if you fulfilled the\
requirements.\
\
Atsuro asks how Jezebel got inside Amane. Naoya said Belberith, whom the\
Shomonkai worships, planted it in her via Amane\'92s innate abilities. You\'92ll have\
to go into her mind \'96 if you attacked her directly and Jezebel escaped, she\'92d\
go back to Belberith and give him her power. If you capture Amane and hook her\
mind up to a COMP, you\'92ll be able to attack, as the Demon Summoning Program\
runs off thoughts and COMPs broadcast one\'92s thoughts to command demons. Atsuro\
says Naoya designed the COMP to be able to do this from the start and asks how\
far he could foresee the future.\
\
Remiel\'92s inside Amane, and calls Naoya Cain, child of God. By God\'92s command,\
Remiel\'92s come to "rend your standard in twain." Naoya laughs, calling them evil\
angels...and Remiel can\'92t even use his full power in Amane\'92s body, anyway.\
\
After you knock Amane unconscious, Naoya says you\'92ll have to take her somewhere\
safe, as your bodies will be defenseless while you\'92re fighting Jezebel. Kaido\
says there\'92s no such place in the lockdown; Naoya reminds him who made the\
system and knows demons well, and says he prepared a place yesterday \'96 a warded\
portion of the Diet Building. Kaido says Naoya knows too much, and that the two\
of them might have to go at it some day. Naoya says for his sake, he hopes not,\
as he\'92s merciless when it comes to nuisances.\
\
Atsuro asks if you can really fight inside a human soul. Naoya says he\'92s\
overthinking this and that a soul isn\'92t as immense as you assume. Just like\
reality, it\'92s based on a combination of external forces and inner thoughts.\
Anyway, you\'92ll be fighting on Jezebel\'92s home turf, plus it might turn Amane\
against you. Kaido doesn\'92t really get it, but asks if you\'92ll have to fight her.\
Naoya says, in a way, as a free Amane would also oppose what you\'92re doing. But\
be careful, because if her soul dies, Jezebel will have full control of her\
body, so you can\'92t kill her.\
\
You get warped into a "Cartesian Garden." A...beautiful field of flowers and a\
crystal clear pond and so on. (We get the symbolism, really.)  Naoya says this\
is the COMP\'92s visualization, and that you\'92ll have to be careful, as if the soul\
senses death, the body will follow its lead, which means you\'92ll die for real.\
You spot Amane, but a voice asks, "Who dares to track mud through another\'92s\
soul?" Oops, looks like it\'92s Jezebel. Suddenly everything goes dark, and the\
once-utopian garden has now become red flaming rock and a lava pond. Charming.\
Jezebel also appears. Naoya reminds you that as he\'92s linked you up to Amane\'92s\
soul, if he dies, you\'92ll be trapped.\
\
After a while, Amane will regain consciousness. Jezebel then deploys several\
Mind Amanes to attack her. Amane says she won\'92t let Jezebel have her way, and\
asks Remiel to give her strength. Atsuro asks if she\'92s okay, and Amane says\
you're the ones who weakened Remiel\'92s power and that you\'92re so frustrating.\
Naoya ignores her and asks if she\'92d rather Jezebel consume her soul. If she\
gets possessed you\'92ll die too, so you\'92ll all need to cooperate here. Amane\
makes an angry face.\
\
After you win, she says she\'92s grateful, but now you\'92re enemies. Naoya says it\
sounds like fun. When Naoya asks, Naoya says to leave her be, otherwise the\
Shomonkai won\'92t leave you alone. Atsuro speaks up, saying it\'92s about time Naoya\
told you the truth about the whole thing. Naoya laughs, saying he thought\
Atsuro\'92d feel that way eventually. Atsuro says he\'92s always like that, deciding\
everything you do. Yuzu was worried about you guys, but you left her anyway to\
follow him; you\'92re not his pawns. Wrong, Naoya says, as you\'92ve never been\
anything but. Either way, your interests all align, but if you don\'92t trust him\
it\'92s not enough, so he\'92ll explain.\
\
You\'92ll have to defeat all the Bels and encounter Babel, a mass of energy lost\
by the original Bel when God cast it into the demon world. The final objective\
is to gain the power dormant within Babel, which is none other than the\
summoning server. Right now, Belberith has it, and is using the server as a\
medium to manifest Babel. Because it harnesses the flow of thoughts, it would\
be best for this task.\
\
So, you just have a few qualifications to meet. The demon world and human world\
are adjacent to each other, and only a wall of power stands between them.\
Destroy the wall, and create a place where Babel can be summoned. Tokyo has\
been protected by the Four Devas until now, and they maintain this wall of\
power and kept demons from entering before. For the Shomonkai to have used\
COMPs in Tokyo, Amane defeated one of the Devas with Jezebel \'96 Jikoku. \
\
You\'92ll have to defeat the remaining Devas, too. You wonder if it\'92s a good idea.\
Naoya says what you\'92ve been doing is basically the same thing; there are only\
days before this imbalance crushes the human world. Basically, you don\'92t have\
a choice.\
\
You\'92re off to Eikokuji, a temple near Ikebukuro. This is what Naoya was\
researching the day before \'96 the Devas.\
\
The group talks about the Devas and Japanese history a little. Atsuro\'92s nervous\
about it, but like it or not, the deadline\'92s 12:00. Bishamon appears. He tells\
you they refuse to let the demon world appear, won\'92t hand you the city, and\
tells you to kneel. If you acquiesce, Naoya tells you to basically stiffen your\
backbone. If you say, "No, YOU," Naoya will say something along the lines of,\
"What a pain. You should\'92ve stayed dead..."\
\
After you defeat Bishamon, Atsuro says he still feels bad, since he was\
protecting all of Tokyo. Kaido mocks him, saying Atsuro didn\'92t come along just\
to save people. "You just want a reason to keep doin\'92 what you\'92re doin\'92. You\
don\'92t want the responsibility." What\'92s wrong with wanting power, he says.\
Atsuro says it\'92s not that easy. Naoya says the world will change, and don\'92t let\
it leave you behind. Afterwards, some sort of dark purple spiral appears in the\
sky. The city\'92s corruption has begun. Kaido feels practically giddy. The next\
Deva\'92s to the south in Sengakuji, in Shinagawa. Naoya says to remain cautious,\
especially since he can\'92t sense one of the Devas.\
\
And yeah \'96 in the next fight, you get to fight both remaining Devas, Zouchou\
and Koumoku, at the same time. After you defeat them, the sky resembles molten\
lava, and there\'92s a hole in it. The portal has been opened. The aperture to the\
demon world is on the top floor of the Hills building, where the Shomonkai\'92s\
server room is. There are also the two Bels, Babel, and even the angels to\
face. Kaido says, so what, since you\'92ll eventually be going up against God\
anyway. Atsuro says it\'92s not like he\'92s doubting them or anything, but...\
\
Naoya decides to tell a story. God\'92s said to be an absolute being in various\
religions and lore, complete in every way. But if he was truly absolute, His\
creation would never falter. Yet humans do become corrupt, and demons do exist\
\'96 proof that He\'92s also flawed. And when His creations don\'92t obey His will, He\
eliminates them. "He doesn\'92t save those who believe in Him. He crushes those\
who don\'92t!" Angels are his messengers, little more than His wrath. Still, if\
you also have to fight the angels...you might have to negotiate with the\
government for more time. Kaido says you\'92d better think about what you\'92re going\
 to say \'96 you can\'92t just tell them you\'92re going to become overlord, but you\
need time. Naoya says maybe it\'92s not a bad idea...\
\
You find Fushimi and Izuna, and Naoya takes over. He says, surely they\'92ve found\
out about him from their research on the Shomonkai. Fushimi says he\'92s always\
wanted to talk to him, the guy who got everyone into this mess, face to face.\
Naoya says not to get emotional; what\'92s he done, anyway? The Shomonkai summoned\
the demons, and the government started the lockdown. Fushimi curses him; Naoya\
says for someone to "muzzle this government lapdog," as he doesn\'92t have the\
time. He tells them you\'92ll be the king of demons.\
\
Fushimi says they\'92d never help you. Naoya says if he really wanted to save the\
people of Tokyo, he\'92d help. After all, once you become overlord, you can order\
demons to keep from attacking humans; fortunately, you\'92re kindhearted. Fushimi\
finds it hard to believe.\
\
Naoya asks if he trusts the angels, then, as they know this mission\'92s futile:\
the final option can\'92t exterminate all the demons, plus you\'92ve already opened a\
portal to the demon world. The world will end, and the angels won\'92t do\
anything. You\'92re done preparing, but you need time. Fushimi says it\'92s not their\
call, as there\'92s a commander outside. Naoya says it doesn\'92t matter how he gets\
it done; think it over. Fushimi says he can\'92t make promises. Naoya says it\'92s\
fine, just remember that everything in the world depends on him. You leave.\
\
Kaido says Naoya had them eating out of his hand, there. Naoya says he just\
told them the truth, a frank and honest negotiation. They put themselves in a\
corner, such a gross "sin." He knows the deadline will now be extended. Atsuro\
says he\'92d hate to have Naoya for an enemy, and asks if what he said about the\
demons was true. Naoya says it wasn\'92t the whole truth, but he told no lies.\
Doesn\'92t matter; the angels coerced the lockdown anyway. Everyone plays dirty.\
Now that the government knows the angels aren\'92t on their side, there\'92ll be a\
bunch of bureaucratic meetings and red tape, which will buy you time.\
\
Once you get to the building, a humongous fly \'96 Belzaboul \'96 stands in your way.\
Just as Naoya planned. He says he\'92ll take your power as an offering to\
Belberith. When asked why, when he\'92s a Bel himself, he says that unfortunately\
it\'92s not his master\'92s wish, and Belzaboul\'92s mission is to get Belberith to the\
throne.\
\
After you win, Naoya says Belzaboul used to be the Duke of Hell. Now that\
you\'92ve defeated him, the power of Bel inside you should be stronger.\
Belberith\'92s the Bel that the Founder summoned. Kaido says he\'92s just an ordinary\
guy, so why did he lend him power? Naoya says that from what he knows, the\
founder genuinely intended to save people, knowing that God\'92s ordeal was close\
and man wouldn\'92t survive. Atsuro says it wouldn\'92t have happened if he hadn\'92t\
caused the lockdown. Naoya says oh, it would have \'96 that\'92s how God is. When you\
ask, he switches the topic back to Belberith, the largest of the demons that\
inherited Bel\'92s power. It really wants revenge against God, hence its role in\
the war. He and the Founder were in accord.\
\
Atsuro says he must be pretty strong by now, with all the Bels he\'92s absorbed.\
But you have the powers of four Bels, and if you fight him in this world, he\
won\'92t be at full strength. If you can\'92t win this way, then he simply can\'92t be\
beaten.\
\
Fushimi appears. He reached a settlement with the top brass, giving you two\
more hours. If you settle it by then, they\'92ll lift the lockdown. He begs you to\
save Tokyo, and wishes you luck.\
\
Atsuro groans at the thought of taking the stairs. You reply, and he says\
you\'92re sounding more and more like Naoya. Naoya asks, did Atsuro say anything?\
Atsuro quickly replies no. Before you go, however, the angels Sariel and Anael\
appear. They call your arrogance inconceivable and tell you to fall to the\
blade of God. Naoya says it\'92s impressive they\'92ve shown up to fight you; must\
be trouble in paradise. Sariel says other humans are incapable of stopping you\
now, and asks if you\'92re willing to be God\'92s messenger \'96 they\'92ll lift the\
lockdown if you do.\
\
Whatever you say, Naoya and the angels exchange words. The angels wonder why\
you, Abel, choose to follow Naoya, asking if you\'92ve truly lost your soul\'92s\
memory. Naoya gets angry and tells you not to listen. Anael calls you foolish,\
saying Naoya once robbed you of your life. Atsuro says you\'92ve made your choice,\
and you can\'92t turn back now.\
\
Sariel once again pleads with you. Naoya mocks how he\'92s trying to work Bel\'92s\
power into his selfish deal. Sariel calls him Cain, who despite being God\'92s\
child, was the first murderer, and says he should die.\
\
After you win, Kaido says that was a waste of time. Atsuro says now that you\'92ve\
fought the angels, this is it. Naoya says that God\'92s world is ruled by absolute\
order and justice, no exceptions. "But it\'92s difficult for a man to go from\
cradle to grave without a single sin, hmm?" By God\'92s and the angels\'92 standards,\
all humans will be judged without mercy. Atsuro says he knows and that he\
doesn\'92t want a world like that, either. Naoya says there\'92s "no need to fear Him\
or to kiss His ass...God\'92s irrelevant. We\'92re all we need." \
\
Atsuro says humans have been trying hard, so to hell with the lockdown. Kaido\
says not to overthink it \'96 you want power, the world, and that\'92s enough to\
fight. But the angels had nerve to ask you to join them. Naoya says they crave\
your potential power. If the overlord were to bow to God, His authority would\
increase, and the demon world\'92s strength would decrease. Eventually demons\
could never challenge God. If you ask about Abel, Naoya doesn\'92t answer.\
\
In the meantime, up the building you go. Everyone else in your party says a\
little "We\'92re going to make it, MC!" type of thing.\
\
...And then the stairs kill everyone, the end. (Kidding.) Kaido grouses, asking\
why the overlord and his minions have to taie the -stairs-. Naoya comments on\
how modern society needs electricity and its conveniences. Atsuro says, "Were\
we really that fragile?"\
\
You get to the top of the Hills and emerge in a strange room with a pipe organ,\
glowing green light, and various hi-tech-ish objects. Naoya says this floor was\
rented and made unavailable to the public, for the summoning server\'92s setup.\
The Founder appears, saying how dare Naoya show his traitorous face, and you\
guys could never understand his glorious ideas. He won\'92t let you use the demons\
to fulfill your desires. Atsuro says he\'92s doing the same thing, and the Founder\
says he\'92s only had one desire \'96 for people to overcome God\'92s ordeal.\
\
He then asks Belberith to descend to this world by consuming his flesh and\
soul, with his only condition being that he then defeats God and brings about a\
world free of His ordeals. Belberith agrees, and a huge, purple mass appears on\
the altar. The Shomonkai cheer his presence.\
\
After you defeat Belberith, Atsuro asks if this was where Naoya accessed the\
server before. He says yes, until Belberith moved it to the demon world...the\
server\'92s properties are already changing inside Babel, but as long as the\
server\'92s components are there, the network should be fine. Atsuro says when\
things get that crazy, his brain can only imagine so much; Naoya says he needs\
to study more.\
\
But, time to summon Babel. Your party members all give a little spiel. The MC\
glows, and suddenly a huge, golden tower shoots down from the sky and crashes\
into the Hills building. A large gray head of a woman with long hair\
appears. And after you defeat the first Babel form, all the Bels reappear. Then\
comes the final form of Babel.\
\
After you get through that, the tower of Babel crashes down. (And wow, that\'92s\
the evilest face the MC\'92s had yet throughout the game.) Your party members all\
say their thing. Atsuro says it\'92d have been better if Yuzu was here with you\
guys. Naoya says you did well, [MC], then corrects himself and says Abel; just\
as he expected. Now that you\'92re overlord, there are things you must do. Are you\
ready...?\
\
Atsuro asks about the lockdown. Naoya says it has no purpose now. "Demons\
challenging angels has nothing to do with the fate of mankind." You\'92re going to\
make those angels understand. Kaido says he gets it \'96 the angels then won\'92t\
deal with humans any more. And if they think you don\'92t care about their\
welfare...well, that gets rid of one of your weak spots. Naoya laughs, and\
says, let them confine and destroy COMP users to their hearts\'92 content. You can\
make demons appear regardless. The people in charge of the lockdown will soon\
realize that. Kaido calls him a nasty piece of work, and says he likes his\
style.\
\
Atsuro stutters, saying even if you\'92ve become overlord, won\'92t it be useless if\
the SDF doesn\'92t trust you? Naoya agrees, so he says you\'92re going to prove your\
strength here and now: declare war on god and call forth your demon army.\
Everything will change; time to begin your new world.\
\
Fushimi gets a message saying that demons are gathering at the Hills. But the\
sky rift is still there...what\'92s going on? Yuzu, standing with Midori, says\
that demons are all on the move and they won\'92t respond to COMPs any more. She\
says your name, and then, "You\'92re...no longer human, are you?" Midori asks\
what\'92s going to happen to them now; Yuzu doesn\'92t know, but says maybe it\'92s a\
little comforting to know that you were the one who became the overlord. As\
long as your heart stays human even during the battle ahead, that is...\
Keisuke hopes that the world won\'92t be ruled by power, and that you\'92re safe.\
The flashy gigolo guy laughs and says you\'92ve done it. "Well done, Naoya. Your\
fondest wish has come true... Or has it?" Win this battle, and mankind may be\
freed from God\'92s judgement. That is, if it doesn\'92t annihilate humanity, he\
laughs; he\'92s looking forward to enjoying this from his box seat.\
\
[All the Bels have been defeated, and the King of Bel has risen.\
\
Witnessing a single young man drive the demons before him, the government saw\
the lockdown\'92s futility and lifted it.\
\
Eventually, the bizarre incidents that began in Tokyo spread across the country\
and the world. Countless demons gathered under Abel to form an army. Shortly\
afterward...the horn of battle sounded. Witnessing the cosmic struggle in awe,\
mankind desperate joined hands with one another so as not to be dragged into\
the conflict. They vowed to live as humans, outside the fray between angels and\
demons.\
\
In this time of suffering, man learned to live within its means.]\
\
(The above is sad against a backdrop of images: the MC in an awesome black\
cape, looking off into the distance; Kaido, looking off to the side; Naoya,\
looking pleased; Atsuro, looking down with his face covered.)\
\
[One day before the war begins, a single email arrives to the COMP you no\
longer need...]\
\
From M:\
\
   "You who are a son of man, yet became king of Pandemonium... You desire\
    to crush underfoot the old order and begin the new, forsaking His\
    command passed down since the dawn of time.\

                                  .................................. [3007] //\}\
\
Yuzu tells you to consider breaking through the lockdown. She doesn't want any\
of you to die, and you've been trying so hard for a week but the last day's\
tomorrow \'96 what can you possibly do? Midori can't sort out her thoughts, and\
Atsuro's convinced that you guys are the only ones who can change anything.\
You have two chances to back out of the route \'96 once with Yuzu, and once with\
Atsuro.\
\
In the morning, Midori tells you she just can't go through with this and wants\
to try doing as much as she can inside the Yamanote circle, and leaves the\
party. Keisuke agrees, and leaves with her. You'll then spend the rest of the\
day checking various points in the circle, looking for a weak spot.\
\
Kaido appears. He asks you if you've seen Honda around, and when you tell him\
your plan to escape, he refuses, saying he won't die.\
\
At Akasaka, Yuzu fervently hopes that Izuna won't be there to block the way,\
but she's there all the same. You tell her you're just seeing how things are\
and she replies that so far, the final option's all that's left. Your party\
leaves, not wanting to fight her.\
\
After looking at all the options, an event at Suidobashi appears. It's Naoya,\
and he asks you what you intend to do now. You tell him your escape plans, and\
he makes sure that's what you want \'96 conviction is important, he says. He then\
says he'll offer help \'96 right now, your only plan is to search for a weak\
point, but he knows that if you try breaking out, reserve squads will pour in\
too quickly. Thus, he'll set up a diversion, splitting their forces in half.\
However, he needs one more person to join in. You have until 16:00 to find one\
more strong COMP user who can break free on his or her own, and then you'll\
meet at Sunset Boulevard.\
\
Several characters appear as options, depending on how you progressed\
throughout the storyline: Gin, Kaido, Midori and Keisuke.\
\
Gin won't go with you. He says that considering the options the government has\
weighed, if they're willing to wipe out the circle, it must be worth it. Your\
team argues, and he laughs, saying you're all really adults. He keeps saying\
that he's tired, and that he'll relax and open up his bar later. He leaves\
with a laugh, saying if you stop by, he'll give you free veggie juice.\
\
Kaido doesn't respond well at first, but once your team tells him that you need\
someone strong to be the bait and that he's strong enough to escape on his own,\
he tells you to count him in. Atsuro fills him in on the meeting spot details.\
\
You have the option of telling Midori and Keisuke about the plan, or keeping\
silent. If you tell them, you'll eventually convince them to join your party\
again.\
\
At 13:30, you meet ???/flashy gigolo guy again. He says he's very disappointed\
in you, and asks, do you know why he kept giving you information on the Bels?\
He then reveals his true form \'96 Loki, and says there's nothing he'd like better\
than to kill you. You had the power to change the world and you threw it away,\
he says, adding, "Or should I call you Abel?"\
\
After you win the battle, Loki warns you that you'll have to fight through\
angels, but just be a little more resolved this time, as he'll always be with\
you now. With that, you can fuse him in the Cathedral of Shadows.\
\
It's 16:00. Your team meets up with Naoya and Kaido at Ikebukuro. Naoya\
explains the mission \'96 he and Kaido will each be acting on his own, while\
everyone else (your team) stays together. At 16:30, you'll attack one point to\
the east and two to the west: Ueno, Shibuya, and Shinjuku, the latter of which\
is merely a diversion. It's heavily guarded by SDF forces and is the central\
point of the plan, as hitting it will draw all the reserve troops there.\
\
Yuzu worries that your team will have to take the Shinjuku spot, saying it\
sounds like a suicide mission, but Naoya laughs it off. He'll go there instead.\
Yuzu says that'd be like leaving him to die, but he replies that he'll overload\
multiple COMPs and let the demons take care of it. If he ever gets the chance,\
he'll show you how to do it too, one day. Naoya also says that he's taking\
Shinjuku because there are mostly SDF forces there, while only angels will be\
at Ueno and Shibuya. He knows the team would rather fight angels than humans,\
and tells the team to get as much revenge on them as it wants. Yuzu agrees,\
saying, "Let me at those angels."\
\
Kaido chooses the Ueno spot, saying he was getting "fed up" with Shibuya. Naoya\
says it's a good choice, saying after the previous day's battle, it should be\
easy to deal with. It leaves you with Shibuya. Atsuro worries about Naoya, but\
he responds that people are merely tools to be used and discarded... He goes\
on, saying that if either team breaks through, the lockdown will fail, and\
he'll decide whether to press on or retreat then. Kaido realizes that\
everyone's lives depend on each team and there's no possibility of betrayal.\
Kaido agrees, emphasizing that a simultaneous strike is necessary; the SDF\
will fear a fourth or fifth strike and won't commit too many troops, but by\
the time they realize, it will be too late.\
\
Kaido says that Naoya's not an ordinary guy and that there are too many like\
him in the lockdown. Naoya agrees. Kaido says despite everything, he doesn't\
hold a grudge, and hopes to meet everyone again.\
\
Naoya instructs you to avoid the station and break through by the Electric\
Museum, where you won't be out in the open. He tells you to remember not to\
die, and says he's sunk pretty far if he's worried about you.\
\
You fight against several angels, including Sariel and Anael. Amane and Izuna\
appear several turns in, and both of them can't believe that you're trying to\
break out of the lockdown. When you win, Yuzu apologizes to them, but can't\
wait to get home. A cutscene kicks in.\
\
[The attempt to break through the lockdown was hard, but successful. \
\
At last, you were headed back home. That was your wish, but the scene before\
you was nothing like the world you all longed for...\
\
Demons thrived as humans fled for their lives. What awaited you on the other\
side was no different than what you left behind.]\
\
Honda's waiting for you outside. He escaped, using you as a diversion. His son\
didn't make it through the operation. He says he has nothing to fight for any\
more, that power is justice, and that only they can change the world. Yuzu is\
horrified. He asks what's wrong, calling the group heroes, saying there's no\
more need to hesitate about using the demons.\
\
You see a scene of carnage.\
\
[The final option was never used, and the lockdown was lifted. Without the\
angels' backing, the SDF suffered defeat after defeat against the demons Honda\
and his comrades summoned.\
\
The collapse is now inevitable.\
\
The angels who could have prevented it have all been defeated by your own hand.\
\
Months after the lockdown's end, in the new world ruled by the strong, when the\
word "peace" has no meaning, you receive an email... ]\
\
From "M":\
   "Within a few nights, demons have stolen order from this world."\
\
[You had understood that the lockdown was to prevent them from being loosed,\
but you cast your eyes away. You did not run from demons. You did not run from\
suffering. You ran from yourself.\
\
If humans prove wise, then someday, peace may return to man's hands.\
\
But you will live in regret until that day comes, son of man, in this world of\
chaos you have brought upon yourself.]\
\
Credits roll. You can now fuse Remiel in the Cathedral of Shadows.\

=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=\
\
Help, I'm stuck at _____ battle and I thought I was at an okay level but your\
strategy isn't working/I keep getting slaughtered/!!\
\
 - It's all right if you're a few levels lower than the enemies you're\
   fighting. Something that most people seem to forget is that -your demons\
   also need to be at comparable levels to your team leaders throughout the\
   game-. Especially if you're on the Last Day, they should not be...oh, let's\
   say 7 levels below you. Keep your demons up to date. Honestly, truly,\
   really.\
\
\
I can't seem to find _______ skill...\
\
 - There are three skills that are exclusive to certain routes:\
    - Full Might - auto - Naoya, Atsuro's/Amane's route\
      -- But, since his Anti-All only shows up on Amane's route...yes.\
         Crack Full Might on the Atsuro route playthrough.\
    - Magic Yin - auto - Amane, Naoya's route\
    - Anti-All - passive - Naoya, Amane's route\
 - Megidolaon's on Naoya (Amane's route) and Shiva. I'd recommend you crack\
   it off Shiva, since you'll be losing out on Anti-All. Remember, Shiva shows\
   up in a free battle at the top of the Hills building after you defeat\
   Belberith (he's pretty rare, so be patient).\
\
\
I followed the event flowchart for ____ route and -still- didn't unlock it!\
\
 - Ah, yes, well. It's not perfect. Simply viewing all those events and meeting\
   the routes' requirements won't unlock them. You know all those bits of\
   dialogue where you have to make some kind of choice and say something? The\
   game tallies up points based on how you answer things. If you don't answer\
   smart, you won't unlock routes. For example, if you answer everything like\
   you're a power-hungry demonic overlord who ridicules the idea of God, you're\
   probably not going to unlock Amane's route. If you ignored Atsuro's ideas,\
   you're probably not getting his. Etc, etc.\
\
\
I'm having the hardest time, and I keep having to restart because I can't get\
x character to crack y skill...\
\
 - Just a reminder to everyone that you -can- access your team leaders' skills\
   in the COMP menu (press Y while hovering above a certain char's avatar). And\
   you can customize skills outside of battle. And you can have characters who\
   can't equip a certain skill still crack it (it just appears gray in the\
   menu). Just putting that out there, since some people seem to miss that.\
\
\
Your Skill Crack list said that an ability would be available on the x'th day,\
but I got it on the x-1'th day...\
\
 - Free battles generate demons randomly. Sometimes, those demons have a\
   different skill set than the normal, as well. Apologies (I didn't feel like\
   duking it out with the RNG to get all possible results, what can I say), and\
   treat it like a bonus?\

Major thanks to Rae for recording some data for me, being supportive in her Rae\
kind of way (re: "Remind me why you're doing this again?" Ahaha.), and helping\
me try to figure out the data system behind the events system and whatnot. And\
dealing with my guide-writing insecurities.\
\
Also, thanks to:\
 - Doug, for the info reminder on the extra Midori backstory event.\
 - Everyone who wrote in about the demon auction's occasional accidents and\
   the lack of penalty you get for defaulting on those. (So I have a faulty\
   memory, like I thought. Oops.)\
 - Brian, for reminding me of another auction demon with Watchful for the\
   Mitama strategy.\
 - Alex Hamerling, for telling me that the Atsuro event necessary for Gin's\
   route isn't a mandatory one (so I put in the asterisks and warnings and all\
   that).\
 - Countless individuals for discussing the Recarm strategy.\
\
And uh. Thanks for reading, and stuff. Hope this helped.\
